Psalm 19 is a majestic hymn that celebrates God’s glory as revealed in both creation and Scripture. The first part of the psalm (verses 1-6) extols the heavens as declaring the glory of God, with the sky proclaiming His handiwork.

Day after day, speech pours forth, and night after night, knowledge is revealed. The sun, like a bridegroom coming from his chamber, rejoices to run its course, its warmth and light reaching the ends of the earth. The second part of the psalm (verses 7-14) shifts to the perfection and power of God’s law.

The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The psalmist concludes with a prayer for cleansing from hidden faults and protection from presumptuous sins, desiring that the words of his mouth and the meditation of his heart be acceptable in God’s sight. 

Psalm 19 invites us to see the world through the eyes of faith, recognizing God’s presence and power in every aspect of creation. It calls us to move beyond a superficial understanding of the world as a collection of objects and events, and to perceive it as a manifestation of God’s glory and a testament to His love. If we use C.S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia, we can imagine seeing the world as if it were Narnia, a world imbued with magic and meaning, where animals speak, trees dance, and the very landscape reflects the character of Aslan, the great Lion. In Narnia, everything is connected to Aslan, and everything points to His goodness and His power. What would happen if we, as God’s children, viewed this world from a Narnian perspective? We would see the beauty of nature as a reflection of God’s creativity and artistry. We would recognize the moral order of the universe, knowing that good will ultimately triumph over evil. We would approach each person with reverence, recognizing them as beings created in God’s image. We would live with a sense of wonder and awe, knowing that we are surrounded by the invisible reality of God’s presence and power.

### Reflective Questions:

1. How does Psalm 19 challenge me to see the world through the eyes of faith, recognizing God’s presence and power in every aspect of creation?

2. In what ways can I cultivate a Narnian perspective, seeing the world as imbued with magic and meaning, where everything points to God’s goodness and power?

3. How does the psalm’s emphasis on the perfection and power of God’s law inspire me to live a life of obedience and devotion?

4. What practices can I incorporate into my daily life to deepen my connection with God and to experience the wonder and awe of His creation?

### Prayer: 
O God, whose glory is revealed in the heavens and whose law is perfect, we thank you for the gift of Psalm 19, which invites us to see the world through the eyes of faith. Help us to recognize your presence and power in every aspect of creation, from the rising of the sun to the falling of the rain. Grant us the grace to live with a Narnian perspective, seeing the world as imbued with magic and meaning, where everything points to your goodness and power. Fill us with your Holy Spirit, that we may live lives that are pleasing in your sight and that reflect the glory of your name. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

    title: "The Breath of God’s Care: A Reflection on Psalm 144:3-4",
    excerpt: "A poignant reflection on the paradox of God’s immense power and His intimate care for humanity.",

Psalm 144:3-4 is a poignant reflection on the paradox of God’s immense power and His intimate care for humanity. The psalmist, overwhelmed by God’s majesty and might, wonders, “Lord, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him?” He then contrasts God’s eternal nature with the fleeting existence of humanity: “Man is like a breath; His days are like a passing shadow.”

These verses capture the tension between our insignificance in the vastness of the cosmos and God’s unwavering attention to each individual. We are but a breath, a fleeting shadow, yet God knows us, is mindful of us, and cares for us with a love that defies comprehension.

This passage invites us to embrace both our humility and our dignity. We are not self-sufficient or immortal beings, but creatures dependent on God for every breath. Yet, we are also the objects of God’s love, created in His image, and destined for eternal life through Christ.

The mystery of God’s care for mortal human beings is a central theme of the Gospel. Jesus, the eternal Son of God, took on human flesh and entered into our fleeting existence, demonstrating the depth of God’s love. He lived, suffered, and died for us, offering us forgiveness, healing, and the promise of eternal life. Through Christ, our mortality is transformed, and our fleeting existence is given eternal significance.

### Reflective Questions:

1. How does Psalm 144:3-4 challenge me to embrace both my humility and my dignity, recognizing my dependence on God and my value in His eyes?
2. In what ways can I cultivate a greater awareness of God’s presence in my daily life, recognizing that He is mindful of me and cares for me with a love that surpasses understanding?
3. How does the Gospel message of Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection transform my understanding of mortality and give eternal significance to my fleeting existence?
4. What practices can I incorporate into my spiritual life to deepen my connection with God and to experience the fullness of His love?

### Prayer:

O God, whose power is infinite and whose love is boundless, we marvel at your care for us, mortal human beings. We are but a breath, a fleeting shadow, yet you know us, are mindful of us, and care for us with a love that defies comprehension. Thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to share in our fleeting existence and to offer us the hope of eternal life. Help us to embrace both our humility and our dignity, recognizing our dependence on you and our value in your eyes. Fill us with your Holy Spirit, that we may live lives that are pleasing in your sight and that reflect the glory of your name. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

    title: "A True Minister",
    excerpt: "The inspiring story of Reverend Hans Egede and his mission to Greenland.",
    date: "November 6, 2025",

    content: `
Reverend Hans Egede felt that God had called him to preach His word to the heathen Eskimos who lived in Greenland. This was not possible for some years, but finally, God opened a way Reverend Egede arrived with a Danish trading company in 1721. 

At that time, The Eskimos in Greenland had never heard about the true God or , His word. They were as very fierce people. If a ship was blown to their shore in a storm, they often killed the people and took all the goods on the ship. A human life was not worth much to them.

This was where Reverend Egede landed. He first built a little hut of dirt, stones,and boards for his family in this very cold country. He then tried to learn Eskimo language. He visited the people in their igloos, which were heated by burning whale oil. The smell was almost unbearable for Reverend Egede, but he continued. He tried to speak to them about God, sin, and salvation in Jesus Christ, but the people only laughed at him. 

The trading company decided that they could not work with these people. They told Reverend Egede to pack his things because they were leaving. He had worked there for two years, but no one had listened to him. But he could not leave so he stayed behind with his family. 

More years went by and still there was no change. Then a plague of smallpox broke out. Several Eskimos died from this serious disease. Smallpox is so contagious that no one dared to enter an igloo where someone had the disease . However, Reverend Egede visited and tried to help each sick person. This made a deep impression upon the Eskimos. They saw that it must be an important message which he was bringing. He must be a wonderful man to risk in this way. After the plague a few Eskimos came to hear him. Then more and more came. God blessed his preaching and people came to know the Lord Jesus as their Savior. Can you imagine Reverend Egede’s joy after working there for so many years? He stayed with the Eskimos for fifteen years and saw a complete change in many people. 

### Question: 
This story shows the love and strong desire, found in a true minister’s heart, to bring in God’s Word. Are you interested in God’s message that your minister brings to you? 

### Scripture Reading: 
1 Corinthians 9 : 16 – 23 .

    title: "A Hindu Becomes a Christian",
    excerpt: "A powerful testimony of a Hindu man finding salvation through reading the Bible.",
    date: "November 5, 2025",
    author: "Providence Team",

    content: `
Many years ago, an English officer, who was in charge of a British station in India, received a message telling him to return to England for a while. He had quite a few Indian people working for him, and wondered who would be able to take his place while he was gone. He was far away from any missionary station, and there was no other English officer there who he could leave in charge. There was a good deal of valuable property at the station. What should he do? He prayed about it and asked the Lord for guidance.

After thinking and praying about it for a while, the officer decided to ask one of the natives, who lived in the neighborhood, to take charge while he was away. He was a heathen man, since most of the natives people were Hindu, but he was respectable, honest, and faithful, and the British officer felt sure that everything would be safe in the care of this man. The man agreed to watch over the station and supervise the workmen as well. Before he left, the officer gave the new supervisor a Bible . He urged him to read it, for in it he would find everything he needed for happiness.

Then the officer went away. He had to go to England, and then to America. More than a year passed before he could return to India. On his homeward journey ,the officer wondered how he would find things on his return. He wondered if the man he had left in charge had taken good care of things. He wondered if the workmen had been well cared for, and if everything had gone smoothly. He wondered whether he would hear many complaints and troubles when he returned.

It was a Saturday evening when he got back to his station, and when Sunday morning came, no one knew yet that he had returned. He looked out of his window as soon as he got up in the morning, and was delighted to see how nice everything looked. He felt sure that the man he had left in charge had taken good care of things. Then he began his day with prayer and Bible reading. 

At about ten o’clock the officer heard a bell ring. Then he saw some of the workmen as well as some of the villagers gather together at the a schoolhouse nearby his house. After a while he heard singing. He wondered what it all meant. He called one of his servants, and asked what they were doing in the schoolhouse. The servant replied that they had church services there now every Sunday. 

“ Has a missionary been here since I have been away? “ asked the officer. 
“ No, sir, “ answered the servant.
“ Then, who started this church? “
“ The ‘sahib ‘ ( the master) did this while you were away, sir, “ was the reply. 
“ And what do they do in the church? “ inquired the officer, who knew that only one or two others in the village besides himself professed to be Christians. 
“ They sing, and pray, and then the man reads to them out of the Bible, and talks to the people about salvation in Jesus Christ. “

Suddenly, the officer understood ! ” Could this really be the result of the Bible he had given to the new Supervisor? This was wonderful news for the British officer. When he left, this man was a heathen. He hated and despised the religion of Jesus. And now, was he really a Christian? The officer hurried over the schoolhouse. After the service, he spoke to the supervisor, who told him what had happened. He had been curious about what was in the Bible, so he began to read it. The Holy spirit showed him that he was a sinner, but also that Jesus Christ is the only Savior for sinners. He was led to hate sin, to pray to God, and to love Jesus Christ. He wanted to serve this wonderful Savior. This man became a missionary to his people, preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ wherever he went.

### Question: 
What did the Holy Spirit show the supervisor?

    title: "Living Sacrifice and Liturgical Worship in the Anglican Tradition",
    excerpt: "Exploring the call of Romans 12:1-2 and its reflection in Anglican worship.",
    date: "July 22, 2025",
    author: "Providence Team",
    category: "Anglican Tradition",
    content: `
### Explanation of the Verse:
Romans 12:1-2 calls Christians to a life of complete dedication to God. “I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship” speaks to a holistic offering—not just actions, but our entire being, motivated by God’s mercy. This isn’t passive but active, a conscious choice. The phrase “spiritual worship” (λατρεία, latreia in Greek, a root of “liturgy”) points to the nature of our service to God. It’s not merely individual piety but a corporate act of devotion. Verse 2, “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect,” emphasizes ongoing transformation. We actively resist worldly conformity and embrace a renewed mind, guided by the Holy Spirit to discern God’s will.

The Anglican tradition deeply reflects this call. The Book of Common Prayer, with its structured liturgy, provides a framework for corporate worship, shaping our lives to reflect this “living sacrifice.” The sacraments, especially Holy Communion, are central, embodying this sacrificial offering and fostering a communal experience of worship. The emphasis on reason and scripture within Anglicanism supports the “renewal of the mind,” encouraging critical engagement with faith and a discerning approach to living out God’s will.

### Reflective Questions:
1. How does the concept of “living sacrifice” challenge your daily life and priorities?
2. How does participating in the Anglican liturgy help you offer yourself as a living sacrifice?
3. In what ways are you conformed to the world? How can you actively pursue transformation through the renewal of your mind?
4. How can you better discern God’s will in your life and actions?

### Prayer:
Almighty God, we thank you for your boundless mercy. Help us to offer ourselves as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to you. Through the beauty and structure of your liturgy, renew our minds and strengthen our resolve to resist worldly conformity. Guide us to discern your will and live lives that glorify your name. Through Christ our Lord, Amen.

### Pengorbanan Hidup dan Ibadah Liturgis dalam Tradisi Anglikan

### Penjelasan Ayat:
Roma 12:1-2 menyerukan kepada orang Kristen untuk hidup dalam pengabdian sepenuhnya kepada Allah.”Karena itu, saudara-saudara, demi kemurahan Allah aku menasihatkan kamu, supaya kamu mempersembahkan tubuhmu sebagai persembahan yang hidup, yang kudus dan yang berkenan kepada Allah: itu adalah ibadahmu yang sejati.” mengacu pada persembahan yang holistik—bukan hanya tindakan, tetapi seluruh keberadaan kita, yang didorong oleh kasih karunia Allah. Ini bukanlah hal yang pasif, melainkan aktif, sebuah pilihan yang sadar. Frasa “ibadah rohani” (λατρεία, latreia dalam bahasa Yunani, akar kata “liturgi”) menunjuk pada sifat pelayanan kita kepada Allah. Ini bukan sekadar kesalehan individu, tetapi tindakan pengabdian bersama. Ayat 2, “Janganlah kamu menjadi serupa dengan dunia ini, tetapi berubahlah oleh pembaharuan budimu, supaya kamu dapat membedakan apa yang adalah kehendak Allah, apa yang baik dan berkenan dan sempurna,” menekankan transformasi yang berkelanjutan. Kita secara aktif menentang keserupaan dengan dunia dan menerima budi yang diperbarui, dipimpin oleh Roh Kudus untuk membedakan kehendak Allah.

Tradisi Anglikan secara mendalam mencerminkan panggilan ini. Buku Doa Umum, dengan liturgi yang terstruktur, menyediakan kerangka kerja untuk ibadah bersama, membentuk hidup kita untuk mencerminkan “korban hidup” ini. Sakramen, terutama Komuni Kudus, menjadi pusat, mewakili persembahan korban ini dan memupuk pengalaman ibadah bersama. Penekanan pada akal budi dan Kitab Suci dalam Anglikanisme mendukung “pembaruan pikiran,” mendorong keterlibatan kritis dengan iman dan pendekatan yang bijaksana dalam hidup sesuai dengan kehendak Allah.

### Pertanyaan Reflektif:
1. Bagaimana konsep “korban hidup” menantang kehidupan sehari-hari dan prioritas Anda?
2. Bagaimana berpartisipasi dalam liturgi Anglikan membantu Anda menawarkan diri sebagai korban hidup?
3. Dalam hal apa Anda menyesuaikan diri dengan dunia? Bagaimana Anda dapat secara aktif mengejar transformasi melalui pembaruan pikiran Anda?
4. Bagaimana Anda dapat lebih baik mendeteksi kehendak Allah dalam hidup dan tindakan Anda?

### Doa:
Allah Yang Mahakuasa, kami bersyukur atas belas kasihan-Mu yang tak terbatas. Bantulah kami untuk mempersembahkan diri kami sebagai persembahan hidup, suci dan berkenan kepada-Mu. Melalui keindahan dan struktur liturgi-Mu, perbarui pikiran kami dan kuatkan tekad kami untuk menolak kesesuaian dengan dunia. Tunjukkanlah kepada kami cara mengenali kehendak-Mu dan hidup yang memuliakan nama-Mu. Melalui Kristus Tuhan kami, Amin.

Anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!
2 CORINTHIANS 5:17

In 2014, Americans spent more than $12 billion on over 10 million cosmetic surgery procedures. Every year more people are having “work done.” In fact, check this out: in 2014, buttock augmentations were up 86 percent over 2013. I didn’t even know I could get my buttocks augmented! I’ve been accepting my buttocks as is for so long, I kind of feel like a fool.

And it’s not just our bodies. In 2012, Americans spent about $284 billion renovating their homes.
Americans also bought 16.5 million new cars in 2014. If you just can’t buy a new car, you can buy a spray bottle of “New Car Scent” fragrance. Personally, I don’t think anyone is going to be fooled when you pull up in your 1977 Malibu Classic with duct tape covering one quarter panel and your 8-track tape player cranking Lynyrd Skynyrd. Your friend is like, “Bob, this car . . . smells so . . . new. Is it new? Did you just buy this?”

I don’t think the reason for cosmetic surgery is that we don’t like our bodies; it’s that we don’t like ourselves. People believe building a new house will satisfy them, but the reality is that only building a new life will give them what they’re truly looking for. A new car might look better than your old one, but only a new life can get you where you want to go.
The reality is I need a new me. And you need a new you.

Remember the glut of “makeover” TV shows? We still have quite a few today, but for a while it seemed like they were on every channel. One of those shows was Extreme Makeover. Here’s what they promised: “a real-life fairy tale in which their wishes come true, not just by changing their looks, but their lives and destinies.” They got one thing right: that is what we need! We need to change our lives and our destinies, but we can’t do that through plastic surgery, remodeling our homes, improving our wardrobes, or pimping our rides, no matter what our culture tells us.

### God’s Image
What’s the reason for this longing we have?
I think it’s because we were made in God’s image. We were designed to live our lives reflecting who he is. That’s why we get so frustrated by our bad choices and bad habits, the things that drag us down, make us mistreat people, and stress us out. We know we were intended for better, but somehow we’ve messed things up. And something inside us screams, “I want to be made new!”

And the good news is that we can be. Here’s the promise we have from God: “Anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!”

If a person makes the decision to belong to Jesus, that person is made new. The old is gone; the new has come.
That should fill you with hope. You can be made new! You can be transformed! You’re not stuck! You can change! You don’t have to live forever the way you are now!
God wants to make you new. He wants you to be like him.

The good news of the Bible is that God loves you not as you should be, but just the way you are. The great news is that God loves you too much to leave you as you are, because there’s something so much better for you. He wants to help you be who you should be, the new you you’ve longed to be.

Jesus lived a perfect life—a life of joy and happiness, a life beyond fear and worry, a life of love and compassion, a life without sin and selfishness. He was pure, peaceful, and purpose driven. He had an unmatched intimacy with God. While God isn’t asking you to stop being you, he does want you to be a new you, a new you that is just like Jesus. The Bible says that as we live out our new identity, we’ll see character traits like “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” growing in our lives.

### A Confused Butterfly
Maybe you’ve become a Christian, but you don’t seem to be becoming more like Jesus. The new you seems a lot like the old you. What’s up with that?
I think the problem for some of us is that we don’t understand the promise God has made us. Since we don’t understand that we have a new identity, we’re still living out our old one.

Imagine a caterpillar. This caterpillar is crawling around in the dirt. Why? Because that’s what caterpillars do. But then this caterpillar goes through an incredible transformation in which it becomes something brand new: a butterfly. It’s a new creation. The old life is gone. The new life has begun. Now that it’s a butterfly, it can take flight and soar through the air. But I want you to imagine this butterfly . . . crawling around in the dirt. What kind of butterfly would crawl around in the dirt? Well, I guess only one who didn’t realize it was a butterfly. A butterfly who thought it was still a caterpillar would continue to crawl in the dirt.

And I wonder if the reason you aren’t living up to God’s promise of you being a new person in Christ is because you don’t understand your new identity. You’re a new person, but you still think you’re the old person. So you still find yourself crawling in the dirt, when you are capable of taking flight.
Understand this: if you’ve become a Christian, even if you are still struggling with your old ways, your old habits, your old sins, that is not the real you anymore.

The apostle Paul struggled with living the same old way even after he became a brand-new person. He writes about it in Romans 7. And what he concludes is interesting and important. He writes, “Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.”
Did you notice the distinction Paul makes? He’s saying, “I know I’m struggling. I know that this sin is in me. But it is not me. I am a new person. I may struggle with things from my past, but I am not my past.”
And you are not your past. You are not your sin. Sin is no longer the truest thing about you.
You are a new person.
God has made you a brand-brand you.

### Now What?
Read 2 Corinthians 3:18.
As a Christ follower, you have a new identity. Your new identity is Jesus’ identity, and it should be becoming a reality in your life “more and more.” What could help you to remember and stay focused on your identity so you can live it out?
We often get stuck thinking of ourselves the way we’ve always thought of ourselves. Ask God to show you the old identity you maybe haven’t let go of yet and to help you believe you really are new in Christ.

### Kasih Sang Raja

Ia menyuruh pula hamba-hamba lain, pesannya: Katakanlah kepada orang-orang yang diundang itu: Sesungguhnya hidangan, telah kusediakan, lembu-lembu jantan dan ternak piaraanku telah disembelih; semuanya telah tersedia, datanglah ke perjamuan kawin ini.
Matius 22:4

Lihatlah Allah yang mengasihi itu dalam raja yang mempersiapkan perjamuan kawin. Bagaimana kita dapat melihat kasihNya itu dalam perumpamaan ini? Pertama, Raja itu mengutus para hambanya. Ini adalah undangan hidup karena disampaikan oleh hamba² raja ini kepada orang² yang diundangnya. Pengutusan para hamba ini adalah sebuah perhatian besar dari sang raja. Para hamba raja itu harus memastikan pesan itu didengar setiap orang secara individu.
Selain itu lihat bagaimana raja itu menyiapkan hidangan, menyembelih lembu jantan dan ternaknya bagi perjamuan ini. Kemurahan hati raja diekspresikan dalam perjamuaan ini. Kasih raja itu dinyatakan dalam suguhan hidangan terbaik melalui lembu² jantan dan ternak² piaraan raja sendiri yang dirawat dengan baik. Anugerah raja dibuka selebar-lebarnya untuk semua dalam hidangan ini.
Yang utama dalam perjamuan ini adalah kehadiran dan kesediaan raja duduk makan sehidangan dengan para tamu yang diundangnya. Duduk sehidangan dengan seorang raja adalah sebuah kehormatan tanpa tandingan.
Ini adalah gambaran kasih, kemurahatian, dan anugerah Allah. Allah yang mengundang perjamuan kawin ini adalah Allah yang mampu dan mau menerima orang yg diundangNya itu untuk menikmati sukacita, kasih dan anugerah Allah dengan tangan yang terbuka.
Itu gambaran kehidupan dalam anugerah Kristus. Berlimpah oleh kasih karunia dari Allah yang memberi anugerah keselamatan kepada orang-orang berdosa seperti kita. Kita diizinkan duduk sehidangan dengan Raja segala raja.
Inilah juga gambaran ibadah Kristen yaitu kita diundang dalam perjamuan anak domba Allah menerima darah dan tubuhNya. Meja perjamuan kudus itu adalah meja sang raja yang membuka diriNya, anugerahNya, dan kasihNya bagi semua yang datang mendekat kepada meja kristus. Apalagi engkau tunggu? Apa yang membuatmu tidak dapat datang ke perjamuan Allah yang mengasihi ini?

### Kemunafikan dan Kecanduan Pujian
Matius 23:1-12

23:1 Maka berkatalah Yesus kepada orang banyak dan kepada murid-murid-Nya, kata-Nya: 23:2 “Ahli-ahli Taurat dan orang-orang Farisi telah menduduki kursi Musa. 3 Sebab itu turutilah dan lakukanlah segala sesuatu yang mereka ajarkan kepadamu, tetapi janganlah kamu turuti perbuatan-perbuatan mereka, karena mereka mengajarkannya tetapi tidak melakukannya. 4 Mereka mengikat beban-beban berat, lalu meletakkannya di atas bahu orang, tetapi mereka sendiri tidak mau menyentuhnya.

Kursi Musa adalah sebuah istilah bahwa mereka adalah pengajar hukum Taurat yang dipandang, tetapi mereka hanya mengajarkan tetapi tidak melakukannya. Itu adalah kemunafikan. Namun, bagaimana dengan apa yang diajarkan oleh Rabi Yesus? Kata beban ini berkaitan dengan Matius 11:30. Yesus memberikan beban yang ringan apa itu? Itu adalah iman. Petrus dan para rasul memutuskan untuk tidak mengenakan sunat sebagai sesuatu yang wajib bagi mereka yang bukan Yahudi untuk disunat dan menuruti hukum Musa. “9 Ia sama sekali tidak mengadakan perbedaan antara kita dengan mereka, sesudah Ia menyucikan hati mereka oleh iman. 10 Kalau demikian, mengapa kamu mau mencobai Allah dengan meletakkan pada tengkuk murid-murid itu suatu kuk, yang tidak dapat dipikul, baik oleh nenek moyang kita maupun oleh kita sendiri? (Acts 15:9-10 ITB)” Matius 5 jelas bahwa Yesuslah yang menggenapi semua hukum Taurat itu.

5 Semua pekerjaan yang mereka lakukan hanya dimaksud supaya dilihat orang; mereka memakai tali sembahyang yang lebar dan jumbai yang panjang; 6 mereka suka duduk di tempat terhormat dalam perjamuan dan di tempat terdepan di rumah ibadat; 7 mereka suka menerima penghormatan di pasar dan suka dipanggil Rabi.

Ayat 5-7 adalah mengenai ruang publik. Ketika seseorang tidak lagi menginginkan sikap hati yang didalam tetapi penampilan luar dan haus hormat, maka dia sedangkan tidak melayani Tuhan tetapi memuaskan dirinya dan menjadikan dirinya pemujaan banyak orang.
Gambaran yang dijelaskan oleh Yesus mengenai kemunafikan orang-orang Farisi begitu gamblang. Mengapa orang-orang Farisi menjadi orang yang munafik? Penghormatan itu adalah candu. J.T. O Donnel menuliskan “Sebagai sifat dasar manusia, kita menyukai perasaan disukai atau dipuji. Konsep ini sangat terbukti dengan betapa kita kecanduan media sosial. Tidak ada yang bisa menyangkal betapa senangnya rasanya ketika kita melihat seseorang menyukai postingan kita atau memberikan komentar positif. Aktivitas tersebut menyebabkan otak kita memproduksi dopamin yang membuat kita merasakan kesenangan yang membuat ketagihan.” Kecanduan inilah yang menuntun banyak orang melakukan pekerjaan karena haus atau kecanduan pujian. Sebuah penelitian terbaru oleh J.T. O’Donnel menunjukkan bahwa lebih dari 70% orang akan menjawab tidak untuk pertanyaan tersebut. Dengan kata lain, mereka merasa karier yang mereka miliki tidak sesuai dengan apa yang seharusnya mereka lakukan. Mereka merasakan ketidakpuasan yang berujung pada menurunnya tingkat kebahagiaan dalam hal pekerjaan profesional mereka. Kesalahan nomor satu adalah ketika kita memilih karir berdasarkan apa yang bisa menyenangkan orang lain atau membuat orang lain terkesan. Belum lagi jika orang-orang tersebut tidak benar-benar layak untuk dibuat terkesan. Namun, membuat orang tua Anda bangga adalah tindakan yang mulia dan keduanya tidak harus saling bertentangan.

8 Tetapi kamu, janganlah kamu disebut Rabi; karena hanya satu Rabimu dan kamu semua adalah saudara. 9 Dan janganlah kamu menyebut siapapun bapa di bumi ini, karena hanya satu Bapamu, yaitu Dia yang di sorga. 23:10 Janganlah pula kamu disebut pemimpin, karena hanya satu Pemimpinmu, yaitu Mesias. 11 Barangsiapa terbesar di antara kamu, hendaklah ia menjadi pelayanmu. 12 Dan barangsiapa meninggikan diri, ia akan direndahkan dan barangsiapa merendahkan diri, ia akan ditinggikan.

Banyak yang berpendapat bahwa Yesus melarang memanggil semua orang sebagai bapa atau menyangkali peran seorang bapa. Perkataan Yesus ini tidak bisa dilihat sepenggal-penggal tetapi harus secara keseluruhan terutama dengan ayat 11 dan 12. Perhatikan bagaimana dia menggunakan gelar-gelar yang dihormati, yaitu Rabi, Bapa (kemungkinan berasal dari Matius 3:9, merujuk klaim Abraham sebagai bapa orang-orang farisi yang munafik), dan Pemimpin (merujuk kepada Musa karena mereka menduduki kursi Musa) dengan menggunakan kata “jangan”. Ini juga bukan berarti bahwa pendeta tidak boleh dipanggil Pendeta, Bapa, Pemimpin atau Guru Besar, karena Yesus sedang membicarakan motif hati yang membanggakan diri, bukan masalah sebutannya.
Yesus sedang mengantisipasi keinginan-keinginan hati yang ada dalam diri para murid-Nya untuk menjadi seperti orang-orang Farisi dan ahli-ahli Taurat dengan negasi negatif “jangan”. Setelah menegasikan sebuah sebuatan itu, lalu dia menekankan mengenai menjadi pelayan. Yang terbesar diantara kamu harus menjadi pelayanmu. Jadi yang harus dikejar adalah bukan sebutan-sebutan rabi, bapa, dan pemimpin tetapi sikap yang merendahkan hati atau melayani sesama saudara. Melihat diri sebagai sesama saudara yang saling melayani bukan menguasai, menaklukkan atau pun memaksa tetapi saling merendahkan diri.
Kemunafikan akan menuntun kepada self destruction. Bukan hanya karena kita sedang melakukan sebuah kebohongan tetapi kita sedang berusaha memecah diri kita menjadi dua pribadi yang berbeda. Kondisi ini sangat menyiksa karena kita akan menuntun kita kepada krisis diri. Kita bisa bercermin dengan film The Queen’s Gambit.
“[Film ini mengisahkan mengenai] Elizabeth Harmon seorang anak yatim piatu yang banyak menghabiskan waktunya di panti asuhan dengan bermain catur. Diajarkan oleh seorang tukang bersih-bersih di panti asuhannya, karakter yang dikenal dengan sebutan Beth ini akhirnya menjadi mahir bermain catur. Ketika beranjak remaja dan akhirnya diadopsi oleh sepasang suami istri, ia pun berkesempatan untuk mengikuti berbagai kompetisi catur. Beth selalu menang dan selalu harus menang. Tanpa sadar, Beth sudah masuk ke dalam kecanduannya akan kemenangan. Sehingga pada saat ia harus kalah, ia mengalami krisis identitas. Beth yang tadinya selalu jadi pemenang tiba-tiba tidak lagi menjadi seorang pemenang. Lambat laun ia kebingungan untuk mencari tahu siapa dirinya di luar kemenangannya. Seakan tidak ada lagi yang memberikannya validasi terhadap apa yang dia lakukan. Terutama ketika ibu angkat yang selalu menemaninya bertanding meninggal. Beth bertambah bingung dan akhirnya perlahan merusak dirinya sendiri karena lagi-lagi kebingungan akan identitasnya yang berubah. Dari seseorang anak angkat yang memiliki orang tua, ia harus kembali pada identitas menjadi seorang anak sebatang kara tanpa keluarga. Akhirnya kebingungan tersebut mengantarnya pada self-destruction. Ia mencari pelarian yang merusak dirinya sendiri sebagai tanda penyangkalan bahwa ia tidak bisa menghadapi dan menerima kenyataan pahit. Ambisinya untuk menjadi seorang pemenang menjadi obsesi yang berujung pada kesulitan penerimaan diri.”

Kemunafikan dan kecanduan pujian memiliki hubungan yang erat dan menghasilkan kerusakan kepada diri sendiri.

Christ is the visible image of the invisible God. He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation.
COLOSSIANS 1:15

WHEN MY KIDS WERE YOUNGER, they wanted a pet. We said no. They begged for a pet. We told them we love other people’s pets.

Finally we caved, but not much. We bought each kid a goldfish. Our son, Dawson, who was five at the time, named his Darth Fishy. Our daughter, Marissa, who was about to turn three, named hers Mackenzie.

We got home, dropped the fish in their tanks, and put the tanks on the shelf. The kids looked at them, looked at us, looked at them, looked at us, and walked away to watch TV. So much for the excitement of having pets.

Later Marissa said, “A fish isn’t a very good pet.” I asked why, and she explained, “Because you can’t really love it, and it doesn’t really love you back.”

“Well,” I tried to encourage her, “you can sort of love it.”

Around that time we started to notice Mackenzie’s tank always had dirtier water than Darth Fishy’s. We couldn’t understand it, until I walked in one day and found Marissa . . . petting her fish. Wanting to show her fish love, turns out she was trying to pet it a few times a day.

Her fish didn’t like it. In fact, her fish would panic and try to get away from the gigantic hand.

I wondered if maybe at night, after we all went to sleep, her fish would get out its diary and write, “It happened again today. It was a normal day, intermittent light, 72 degrees, pink gravel beneath me. I was trying to decide, should I swim towards the surface or bottom, swim right or left, when suddenly it appeared—the shadow. The shadow is always the first sign that it’s coming. Then it arrived, five enormous protruding limbs and a meaty paw trying to crush me. But I will not be destroyed by it! I did everything I could to get away! It did trap me in a corner and touch me, but only for a second. Then from somewhere in the heavens, I heard a thundering noise.”

And the thundering noise was, of course, Marissa yelling, “Daddy, I just petted my fish!”

### Resistant to Love
Have you ever thought about what it’s like to be God? The Bible tells us that God is love and created us in love and for love.

But very quickly there was a problem in God’s creation: these humans were resistant to love, and they didn’t do well at loving God back. It wasn’t so much that they didn’t want love, because they did. But much of the time they didn’t recognize it; much of the time they tried to get away from it.

All through the Old Testament we see God trying to share his love with people, and consistently people running from God and rejecting his love. In the last book of the Old Testament God says, “I have always loved you,” then, “But you retort, ‘Really? How have you loved us?’”

I can imagine God thinking, How have I loved you? I’ve done everything for you! How else could I love you? What can I do to get you to accept my love?

And it was almost as if God had an idea.

### God Came for Us
Watching my daughter try to love her fish, I felt so bad for her. She just wanted to show love, but no matter what she did, her fish would not accept it as love. She would try to pet the fish, and it would run away as if Freddy Krueger were after it. There was just no way for Marissa to connect with and communicate love to her fish.

But what if there were some way for Marissa to get in the tank? If she could somehow become a fish, she could show her fish love in a way it could understand. That might actually work.

God’s idea was to get in the tank. To become like the ones he loved, so he could communicate his love.

This is described in the book of John, where Jesus is referred to as “the Word.” The book of John begins by explaining that Jesus was with God and was God from the beginning: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”

And then God jumped into the tank. “The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.” Jesus left heaven to come to the world.

Another passage in the Bible describes it this way: “Though he was God, he did not think of equality with God as something to cling to. Instead, he gave up his divine privileges; he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being. . . . He appeared in human form.”

God became one of us. So when we look at Jesus, we see God. Jesus is exactly God and exactly what God is like. The Bible says “Christ is the visible image of the invisible God” and “the Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being.”

That is kind of ironic, because some people say, “Yeah, I’ve read the Bible, and I like Jesus, but I don’t like the God of the Old Testament.” But they’re actually exactly the same.

So why does there seem to be such a difference?

Well, why was Marissa’s fish scared of her? Why, when Marissa put her hand in to pet her fish, did her fish flee as if its life were in danger? Because Marissa was just too big, too different, too above her fish for her fish to understand her love.

If Marissa could have gone into her tank as a fish and snuggled a little, maybe her fish would have understood her love. Her love wouldn’t be any different; it would just be on a level her fish could understand.

Why did God become one of us? “God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son.” Jesus came because of God’s love and to express God’s love.

### Murder in the Fish Degree
Think about this: What if Marissa became a fish and got in the bowl, but her fish didn’t snuggle up and love her back? What if her fish killed her?

That’s exactly what happened to Jesus. He got into our skin, came to the world, and the people he came to love killed him.

But that was part of God’s plan as well.

It was part of God’s plan, because God created us in love and for love. We exist to be in relationship with God. But we’ve all walked away from that relationship, and God had to create a way to bring us back to him. Jesus said, “I am the way.” God had to create a bridge to span the gap between us. Jesus is that bridge. God had to do something about the sin that stains us and separates us from a perfectly pure God. The Bible says that Jesus became sin for us and did away with all of our sin on the cross. It was all part of God’s plan, because God created us in love and for love. And Jesus’ coming and dying was the only way we could be in relationship with him.

### Now What?
Read Philippians 2:6-11.
This passage describes the descent Jesus made from heaven to earth to the cross. What do you find in these verses to be thankful for? What do you find in Jesus that you should emulate?
Thank God for Jesus. Thank him that Jesus was humble enough to become a human and loved you enough to die for you.

Everything comes from him and exists by his power and is intended for his glory. All glory to him forever! Amen.
ROMANS 11:36

A FEW YEARS AGO I SAW A MOVIE where the main character says he feels like life is a movie, and he’s the star of it. Everyone else—his neighbors, coworkers, family members, the waitress at the restaurant—are just supporting actors making occasional cameo appearances in the movie about his life.
The idea would be kind of clever and funny if it didn’t hit so close to home.
Do you feel like the star of your story? Does it seem like your family and friends have been included in it to support you? And the waitress and garbage man and grocery clerk exist to serve you?
We would never say it like that, but most people think that way. And can I suggest it’s why most people go through life mostly sad?
There’s a little problem with the way we tend to think.
It’s all wrong.
Life is a story, but it’s not about you.
God is the star of the story.

### Life: Starring God
It’s all about God.
If you kind of think of yourself as the center of the universe, this idea will bother you, but it’s all about God.
It’s always been all about God. In fact, in the beginning, there was only God. Now don’t picture God being lonely, because he wasn’t. As I’ve mentioned, God has always existed in perfect community. He is three, yet one. The word Trinity is often used to describe this idea. God is three distinct beings who live in such tight-knit, loving, bonded community that they exist as only one being, one God. One God made up of three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
God is the star. And somehow, despite being God, God is so humble that each member of the Trinity tries to make the others the stars. We see God the Father glorifying his Son Jesus. We see Jesus glorifying his Father. We see the Holy Spirit of God glorifying God the Son. God is so humble that each member of the Trinity tries to defer glory to the other members of the Trinity. But make no mistake, God is the star of the story.
And God decided to create. He created a universe, an earth. Why? “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.” The creation glorifies the Creator. Nature points to God, because he is the star of the story.
God also decided to create people. Why? God says, “I have made them for my glory.” In fact, we’re commanded, “Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.” And we’re given this blessing: “May you always be filled with the fruit of your salvation—the righteous character produced in your life by Jesus Christ—for this will bring much glory and praise to God.” We exist to glorify God. We’re to point our lives at him and honor him as the star of the story.

### Who Will Be the Star of Your Story?
So the question you and I have to answer, not just one initial time, but a thousand times every day, is: Who will be the star of my story? Will I live my life and make decisions to try to glorify myself, or will I seek to bring glory to God in everything I do?
You may think living your life for God’s pleasure instead of for your desires might lead you to a smaller life, but exactly the opposite will happen. Your life will be so much bigger and so much better.

### Are You Sure God Is the Star?
Some people choose to construct and live out their own stories. Then at some point they invite God into their stories. They’ll tell you, “I invited Jesus into my life.” But honestly, the way they live their lives reveals that it’s still their story.
God’s not proposing that we invite him into our lives. He’s asking us to give him our lives. We surrender our lives to God’s will and to living for his glory. We say, “I want to be a part of God’s story. And even if I just get a bit part, that’s okay, because I’m still part of the BIG story. Because pleasing and bringing glory to God is the most significant thing I can experience, that’s what I want to do with my life.”

### Now What?
Read Colossians 3:1-17.
How does this passage describe a life lived for God’s glory? What do you think would need to change for your life to better point to and glorify God as the star of the story?
Tell God that he is the star of your story. Admit to him your fears about that and the ways you feel inadequate to actually live that way. Ask him for help!

### Hypocrisy and Praise Addiction
Matthew 23:1-12

“Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, 2 “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat, 3 so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice. 4 They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger.”

The seat of Moses is a term that they are teachers of the Law seen, but to only teach but do is hypocrisy. What about what Rabbi Jesus taught? The word burden is related to Matthew 11:30. Jesus gave a light burden what is it? It is faith. Peter and the apostles decided not to impose circumcision as it was mandatory for those who were not Jews to be circumcised and obey the law of Moses. “9 He made no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith. 10 Why then do you want to tempt God by putting a yoke on the disciples’ neck, which neither our fathers nor we ourselves could bear?” (Acts 15:9-10 ITB) Matthew 5 is clear that Jesus is the fulfilment of the law.

“5 They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, 6 and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues 7 and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others.”

Verses 5-7 are about the public space. When one no longer desires an inward heart attitude but an outward appearance and thirsts for honour, then he is meanwhile not serving God but gratifying himself and making himself the idol of many.
Jesus’ description of the Pharisees’ hypocrisy is very clear. Why did the Pharisees become hypocrites? Honor is like an opiate. J.T. O Donnel wrote, “As a matter of human nature, we like the feeling of being liked or praised. This concept is very evident in how addicted we are to social media. No one can deny how good it feels when we see someone like our post or leave a positive comment. The activity causes our brain to produce dopamine, which makes us feel an addictive pleasure.” It is this addiction that leads many people to do work out of thirst or addiction to praise.

“8 But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. 9 And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. 10 Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. 11 The greatest among you shall be your servant. 12 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”

Many argue that Jesus forbids calling everyone father or denying the role of a father. Notice how he uses the honored titles of Rabbi, Father (possibly from Matthew 3:9, referring to Abraham’s claim to be the father of the hypocritical Pharisees), and Leader (referring to Moses because they occupied Moses’ seat) by using the word “do not”. This is also not to say that pastors should not be called Pastor, Father, Leader or Professor, because Jesus was talking about the motive of a proud heart, not the designation.

    excerpt: "Why did the two disciples ask Jesus to stay? Exploring the authority of Scripture.",

### Why did the two disciples ask Jesus to stay?

I listened to two sermons that expounded on this journey to Emmaus. Both of the preachers concluded that the act of Jesus walking “as if he were going farther” was because Jesus didn’t force the disciples to know that He is Jesus who has raised up from the dead and He is the Messiah. Both of them gave good applications in their sermons, that Jesus didn’t impose himself to be recognized but He gave them a choice to choose. One of the preachers continues to expand this notion to the freewill status of a man. So both preachers show Christ’s character in a very gentle way. However, we only noticed what was happening inside the disciple’s hearts at the end of the story when they realized that the person who was talking with them was Jesus Christ. They said to each other “Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?” (v. 32).

I think the main focus comes to play on the reason why the disciples asked Jesus to stay. Yes, agree that Jesus didn’t force people to decide yet Jesus’s expounding the scriptures was one of the means by which the disciple finally decided to have him stay with them. In other words, Jesus raised the authority of scripture to a level, and not only its become a relevant thing, but also it was the real thing. The scripture came alive through the messiah who fulfilled, that is Jesus Christ himself.

The big idea of Jesus’ explanation, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, throughout the scriptures, was that Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory. Jesus posed his main idea with a question “Was it not necessary that Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” Why? It was a way for the disciples to think and digest slowly what Jesus was going to explain from the Scriptures about himself. It was a way that tells us about the context of the passage and that what happened with Jesus of Nazareth was known by all people in Jerusalem.

### Who is the twin in the Gospel of John?

Begins with John 11:16, “So Thomas called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.” This verse was the first appearence of Thomas in the Gospel of John. Thomas is depicted as pessimistic. He was doubting that Jesus’s visit would not change anything, Lazarus died and was not asleep; this was also reflected by other disciples. But Thomas added a very sarcastic statement. He picked up Jesus’s line that said “…let us go to him”, which referred to Lazarus. He changed it into “Let us also go to die with Him”, which referred to Jesus, the context was mentioned in verse 8, “the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?”. So Thomas reflected on the disciples’ doubt about going to Judea because the Jews wanted to stone Jesus and Lazarus was dead, not asleep.

The second appearance of Thomas was in John 14:5, “Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” This verse as well depicting Thomas’s doubt about what Jesus has said. Jesus said, ”And you know the way to where I am going.” He was the representative of the disciples because he used the word “we”. So Thomas’s doubting question to Jesus’ statement was from the whole disciples’ point of view.

The third appearance, the pivotal moment, of Thomas was in the second gathering, or the second Sunday after the Sunday resurrection of Jesus. John 20:24 mentioned Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus was not with all the rest of the disciples, at the first appearance to the almost whole disciples, minus Thomas. They all saw Jesus. Jesus said, “Peace be with you” and after saying that, he showed them his hands and side. So they told Thomas what they saw at the second gathering. They said, “We have seen the Lord”.

Interesting little info that is often overlooked. Zacchaeus was no ordinary tax collector. He’s the chief tax collector. He has subordinates under him. He was responsible for all reports of tax collection from his subordinates to the Roman empire. If even a tax collector was hated by the Jews, how much more was this Zacchaeus. The tax collector was regarded not only as a traitor or robber of his own nation but also as a sinner in the category of the Jews. That means Zacchaeus is the chief of sinners.

In verse 7 it says: 7 And when the people saw it, they all complained, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”

If Jesus came looking for “the most sinner of sinners” and saved “the most sinner”. In verse 10 it is written: 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.” This is a continuation of the theme of the lost lamb, coin and youngest and eldest son.

If the prodigal son is the youngest running for pleasure and worldly satisfaction. His father ran to him and hugged him. If the prodigal son asked for wealth from his father to spend on himself, Zacchaeus gave half of his property to someone else and paid 4 times what he had extorted.

All this happened when Jesus came to stay at his house. Interestingly, Jesus did not say anything about what would normally be considered “spiritual”. He just said ”Zaccheus, hurry down, because today I have to stay at your house.” Of course Jesus knew who Zacchaeus was, didn’t give any theological argument verbally that God loves and seeks sinners but he immediately showed his argument through his actions.

“Love bade me welcome…” —George Herbert
“Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God. And that is what we are!” —St. John the Apostle

I once spoke at a retreat in the Poconos. The menu was bizarre to a degree that became legendary among the participants, but the scenery was nice, and two young men professed faith in Christ during the weekend. Ever curious about what God uses to move different individuals, I asked one of them what had been faith’s tipping point. It had been the idea that God loved him.

God’s love has wonderstruck many, and for some it becomes a lifelong source of amazement. That was true for the one known to history as “the beloved disciple,” St. John. Late in his own spiritual journey the wonder was still with him as he wrote these words that have been dancing in my own imagination of late:

“Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God. And that is what we are!” 1 John 3:1

Back when words seemed to matter more than they do now, bible teachers would look a word up, pull it apart, and squeeze it until the essential oils oozed out. I fell back to that old habit and looked up the etymology of the word behold. I was curious because modern translations tend to begin 1John 3:1: with see rather than behold, as in, “See the love the Father has given to us…” It works well enough, but behold was too plump and ripe not to be squeezed. It is made up of two parts. The be- was originally spelled bi- and meant “thoroughly” (think of bisect). Then the second part, hold derived from halden, a word that meant, surprise, ‘hold’. Only English, out of the various Germanic languages, welded those two bits together to express the idea of looking. It is used in our passage, not of literal sight, but of figuratively ‘giving regard to’ God’s love, or ‘keeping it in view’.
