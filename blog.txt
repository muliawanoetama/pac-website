Seeing Aslan’s World: A Reflection on Psalm 19
Explanation:

Psalm 19 is a majestic hymn that celebrates God’s glory as revealed in both creation and Scripture. The first part of the psalm (verses 1-6) extols the heavens as declaring the glory of God, with the sky proclaiming His handiwork.

Day after day, speech pours forth, and night after night, knowledge is revealed. The sun, like a bridegroom coming from his chamber, rejoices to run its course, its warmth and light reaching the ends of the earth. The second part of the psalm (verses 7-14) shifts to the perfection and power of God’s law.

The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The psalmist concludes with a prayer for cleansing from hidden faults and protection from presumptuous sins, desiring that the words of his mouth and the meditation of his heart be acceptable in God’s sight. 

Psalm 19 invites us to see the world through the eyes of faith, recognizing God’s presence and power in every aspect of creation. It calls us to move beyond a superficial understanding of the world as a collection of objects and events, and to perceive it as a manifestation of God’s glory and a testament to His love. If we use C.S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia, we can imagine seeing the world as if it were Narnia, a world imbued with magic and meaning, where animals speak, trees dance, and the very landscape reflects the character of Aslan, the great Lion. In Narnia, everything is connected to Aslan, and everything points to His goodness and His power. What would happen if we, as God’s children, viewed this world from a Narnian perspective? We would see the beauty of nature as a reflection of God’s creativity and artistry. We would recognize the moral order of the universe, knowing that good will ultimately triumph over evil. We would approach each person with reverence, recognizing them as beings created in God’s image. We would live with a sense of wonder and awe, knowing that we are surrounded by the invisible reality of God’s presence and power.

Reflective Questions:

1. How does Psalm 19 challenge me to see the world through the eyes of faith, recognizing God’s presence and power in every aspect of creation?

2. In what ways can I cultivate a Narnian perspective, seeing the world as imbued with magic and meaning, where everything points to God’s goodness and power?

3. How does the psalm’s emphasis on the perfection and power of God’s law inspire me to live a life of obedience and devotion?

4. What practices can I incorporate into my daily life to deepen my connection with God and to experience the wonder and awe of His creation?

Prayer: O God, whose glory is revealed in the heavens and whose law is perfect, we thank you for the gift of Psalm 19, which invites us to see the world through the eyes of faith. Help us to recognize your presence and power in every aspect of creation, from the rising of the sun to the falling of the rain. Grant us the grace to live with a Narnian perspective, seeing the world as imbued with magic and meaning, where everything points to your goodness and power. Fill us with your Holy Spirit, that we may live lives that are pleasing in your sight and that reflect the glory of your name. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Breath of God’s Care: A Reflection on Psalm 144:3-4
Explanation:

Psalm 144:3-4 is a poignant reflection on the paradox of God’s immense power and His intimate care for humanity. The psalmist, overwhelmed by God’s majesty and might, wonders, “Lord, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him?” He then contrasts God’s eternal nature with the fleeting existence of humanity: “Man is like a breath; His days are like a passing shadow.”

These verses capture the tension between our insignificance in the vastness of the cosmos and God’s unwavering attention to each individual. We are but a breath, a fleeting shadow, yet God knows us, is mindful of us, and cares for us with a love that defies comprehension.

This passage invites us to embrace both our humility and our dignity. We are not self-sufficient or immortal beings, but creatures dependent on God for every breath. Yet, we are also the objects of God’s love, created in His image, and destined for eternal life through Christ.

The mystery of God’s care for mortal human beings is a central theme of the Gospel. Jesus, the eternal Son of God, took on human flesh and entered into our fleeting existence, demonstrating the depth of God’s love. He lived, suffered, and died for us, offering us forgiveness, healing, and the promise of eternal life. Through Christ, our mortality is transformed, and our fleeting existence is given eternal significance.

Reflective Questions:

1. How does Psalm 144:3-4 challenge me to embrace both my humility and my dignity, recognizing my dependence on God and my value in His eyes?
2. In what ways can I cultivate a greater awareness of God’s presence in my daily life, recognizing that He is mindful of me and cares for me with a love that surpasses understanding?
3. How does the Gospel message of Christ’s incarnation, death, and resurrection transform my understanding of mortality and give eternal significance to my fleeting existence?
4. What practices can I incorporate into my spiritual life to deepen my connection with God and to experience the fullness of His love?

Prayer:

O God, whose power is infinite and whose love is boundless, we marvel at your care for us, mortal human beings. We are but a breath, a fleeting shadow, yet you know us, are mindful of us, and care for us with a love that defies comprehension. Thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to share in our fleeting existence and to offer us the hope of eternal life. Help us to embrace both our humility and our dignity, recognizing our dependence on you and our value in your eyes. Fill us with your Holy Spirit, that we may live lives that are pleasing in your sight and that reflect the glory of your name. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

A True Minister  

                      
        Reverend Hans Egede felt that God had called him to preach His word to the  heathen Eskimos who lived in Greenland. This was not possible for some years, but finally, God opened a way Reverend Egede arrived with a Danish trading company in 1721. 
         At that time, The Eskimos in Greenland had never heard about the true God or , His word. They were as very fierce people. If a ship was blown to their shore in a storm, they often killed the people and took all the goods on the ship. A human life was not worth much to them.
         This was where Reverend Egede landed. He first built a little hut of dirt, stones,and boards for his family in this very cold country.  He then tried to learn Eskimo language. He visited the people in their igloos, which were heated by burning whale oil. The smell was almost unbearable for Reverend Egede, but he continued. He tried to speak to them about God, sin, and salvation in Jesus Christ, but the people only laughed at him. 
        The trading company decided that they could not work with these people. They told Reverend Egede to pack his things because they were leaving. He had worked there for two years, but no one had listened to him. But he could not leave so he stayed behind with his family. 
         More years went by and still there was no change. Then a plague of smallpox broke out. Several Eskimos died from this serious disease.  Smallpox is so contagious that no one dared to enter an igloo where someone had the disease . However, Reverend Egede visited and tried to help each sick person.  This made a deep impression upon the Eskimos.  They saw that it must be an important message which he was bringing. He must be a wonderful man to risk in this way.  After the plague  a few Eskimos came to hear him. Then more and more came. God blessed his preaching  and people came to know the Lord Jesus as their Savior. Can you imagine Reverend Egede’s joy after working there for so many years? He stayed with the Eskimos for fifteen years and saw a complete change in many people. 

Question : This story shows the love and strong desire, found in a true minister’s heart, to bring in God’s Word.  Are you interested in God’s message that your minister brings to you? 
Scripture Reading : 1 Corinthians 9 : 16 – 23 .

A Hindu Becomes a Christian

         Many years ago, an English officer, who  was in charge of a British station in India, received a message telling him to return to England for a while. He had quite a few Indian people working for him, and wondered who would be able to take his place while   he was gone. He was far away from any missionary station, and there was no other English officer there who he could leave in charge.  There was a good deal of valuable property at the station. What should he do?  He prayed about it  and asked the Lord for guidance.
        After thinking and praying about it for a while, the officer decided to ask one of the natives, who lived in the neighborhood, to take charge while he was away. He was a heathen man, since most of the natives people were Hindu, but he was respectable, honest, and faithful, and the British officer felt sure that everything would be safe in the care of this man. The man agreed to watch over the station and supervise the workmen as well. Before he left, the officer gave the new supervisor a Bible . He urged him to read it, for in it he would find everything he needed for happiness.
       Then the officer went away. He had to go to England, and then to America. More than a year passed before he could return to India. On his homeward journey ,the officer wondered how he would find things on his return. He wondered if the man he had left in charge had taken good care of things.  He wondered if the workmen had been well cared for, and if everything had gone smoothly. He wondered whether he would hear many complaints and troubles  when he returned.
       It was a Saturday evening when he got back to his station, and when Sunday morning came, no one knew yet that he had returned. He looked out of his window as  soon as he got up in the morning, and was delighted to see how nice everything looked. He felt sure that the man he had left in charge had taken good care of things. Then he began his day with prayer and Bible reading. 
      At about ten o’clock the officer heard a bell ring. Then he saw some of the workmen    as well as some of the villagers gather together at the a schoolhouse nearby his house. After a while he heard singing. He wondered what it all meant. He called one of his servants, and asked what they were doing in the schoolhouse. The servant replied that
they had church services there now every Sunday. 
      “ Has a missionary been here since I have been away? “ asked the officer. 
      “  No, sir, “  answered the servant.
      “  Then, who started this church? “
      “  The ‘sahib ‘ ( the master) did this while you were away, sir, “ was the reply. 
“ And what do they do in the church? “ inquired the officer, who knew that only one or two others in the village besides himself professed to be Christians.  
“ They sing, and pray, and then the man reads to them out of the Bible, and talks to    the people about salvation in Jesus Christ. “
            Suddenly, the officer understood ! ” Could this really be the result of the Bible he had    given to the new Supervisor?  This was wonderful news for the British officer. When he left, this man was a heathen. He hated and despised the religion of Jesus. And now, was he really a Christian? The officer hurried over the schoolhouse. After the service, he spoke to the supervisor, who told him what had happened. He had been curious about what was in the Bible, so he began to read it. The Holy spirit showed him that he was a sinner, but also that Jesus Christ is the only Savior for sinners.  He was led to hate sin, to pray to God, and to love Jesus Christ. He wanted to serve this wonderful Savior. This man became a missionary to his people, preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ wherever he went.

Question :  What did the Holy Spirit show  the supervisor ?
Scripture reading :  Acts 8 : 26 – 40.

Living Sacrifice and Liturgical Worship in the Anglican Tradition


Explanation of the Verse:
Romans 12:1-2 calls Christians to a life of complete dedication to God.  “I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship” speaks to a holistic offering—not just actions, but our entire being, motivated by God’s mercy.  This isn’t passive but active, a conscious choice.  The phrase “spiritual worship” (λατρεία, latreia in Greek, a root of “liturgy”) points to the nature of our service to God.  It’s not merely individual piety but a corporate act of devotion.  Verse 2, “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect,” emphasizes ongoing transformation.  We actively resist worldly conformity and embrace a renewed mind, guided by the Holy Spirit to discern God’s will.

The Anglican tradition deeply reflects this call.  The Book of Common Prayer, with its structured liturgy, provides a framework for corporate worship, shaping our lives to reflect this “living sacrifice.”  The sacraments, especially Holy Communion, are central, embodying this sacrificial offering and fostering a communal experience of worship.  The emphasis on reason and scripture within Anglicanism supports the “renewal of the mind,” encouraging critical engagement with faith and a discerning approach to living out God’s will.

Reflective Questions:
1. How does the concept of “living sacrifice” challenge your daily life and priorities?
2. How does participating in the Anglican liturgy help you offer yourself as a living sacrifice?
3. In what ways are you conformed to the world? How can you actively pursue transformation through the renewal of your mind?
4. How can you better discern God’s will in your life and actions?

Prayer:
Almighty God, we thank you for your boundless mercy.  Help us to offer ourselves as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to you.  Through the beauty and structure of your liturgy, renew our minds and strengthen our resolve to resist worldly conformity.  Guide us to discern your will and live lives that glorify your name.  Through Christ our Lord, Amen.

Pengorbanan Hidup dan Ibadah Liturgis dalam Tradisi Anglikan

Penjelasan Ayat:
Roma 12:1-2 menyerukan kepada orang Kristen untuk hidup dalam pengabdian sepenuhnya kepada Allah.”Karena itu, saudara-saudara, demi kemurahan Allah aku menasihatkan kamu, supaya kamu mempersembahkan tubuhmu sebagai persembahan yang hidup, yang kudus dan yang berkenan kepada Allah: itu adalah ibadahmu yang sejati.” mengacu pada persembahan yang holistik—bukan hanya tindakan, tetapi seluruh keberadaan kita, yang didorong oleh kasih karunia Allah. Ini bukanlah hal yang pasif, melainkan aktif, sebuah pilihan yang sadar. Frasa “ibadah rohani” (λατρεία, latreia dalam bahasa Yunani, akar kata “liturgi”) menunjuk pada sifat pelayanan kita kepada Allah. Ini bukan sekadar kesalehan individu, tetapi tindakan pengabdian bersama.  Ayat 2, “Janganlah kamu menjadi serupa dengan dunia ini, tetapi berubahlah oleh pembaharuan budimu, supaya kamu dapat membedakan apa yang adalah kehendak Allah, apa yang baik dan berkenan dan sempurna,” menekankan transformasi yang berkelanjutan. Kita secara aktif menentang keserupaan dengan dunia dan menerima budi yang diperbarui, dipimpin oleh Roh Kudus untuk membedakan kehendak Allah.

Tradisi Anglikan secara mendalam mencerminkan panggilan ini. Buku Doa Umum, dengan liturgi yang terstruktur, menyediakan kerangka kerja untuk ibadah bersama, membentuk hidup kita untuk mencerminkan “korban hidup” ini.  Sakramen, terutama Komuni Kudus, menjadi pusat, mewakili persembahan korban ini dan memupuk pengalaman ibadah bersama. Penekanan pada akal budi dan Kitab Suci dalam Anglikanisme mendukung “pembaruan pikiran,” mendorong keterlibatan kritis dengan iman dan pendekatan yang bijaksana dalam hidup sesuai dengan kehendak Allah.

Pertanyaan Reflektif:
1. Bagaimana konsep “korban hidup” menantang kehidupan sehari-hari dan prioritas Anda?
2. Bagaimana berpartisipasi dalam liturgi Anglikan membantu Anda menawarkan diri sebagai korban hidup?
3. Dalam hal apa Anda menyesuaikan diri dengan dunia? Bagaimana Anda dapat secara aktif mengejar transformasi melalui pembaruan pikiran Anda?
4. Bagaimana Anda dapat lebih baik mendeteksi kehendak Allah dalam hidup dan tindakan Anda?

Doa:
Allah Yang Mahakuasa, kami bersyukur atas belas kasihan-Mu yang tak terbatas. Bantulah kami untuk mempersembahkan diri kami sebagai persembahan hidup, suci dan berkenan kepada-Mu. Melalui keindahan dan struktur liturgi-Mu, perbarui pikiran kami dan kuatkan tekad kami untuk menolak kesesuaian dengan dunia. Tunjukkanlah kepada kami cara mengenali kehendak-Mu dan hidup yang memuliakan nama-Mu. Melalui Kristus Tuhan kami, Amin.

A New You

Anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!
2 CORINTHIANS 5:17
IN 2014, AMERICANS SPENT MORE THAN $12 BILLION on over 10 million cosmetic surgery procedures. Every year more people are having “work done.” In fact, check this out: in 2014, buttock augmentations were up 86 percent over 2013. I didn’t even know I could get my buttocks augmented! I’ve been accepting my buttocks as is for so long, I kind of feel like a fool.
And it’s not just our bodies. In 2012, Americans spent about $284 billion renovating their homes.
Americans also bought 16.5 million new cars in 2014. If you just can’t buy a new car, you can buy a spray bottle of “New Car Scent” fragrance. Personally, I don’t think anyone is going to be fooled when you pull up in your 1977 Malibu Classic with duct tape covering one quarter panel and your 8-track tape player cranking Lynyrd Skynyrd. Your friend is like, “Bob, this car . . . smells so . . . new. Is it new? Did you just buy this?”
I don’t think the reason for cosmetic surgery is that we don’t like our bodies; it’s that we don’t like ourselves. People believe building a new house will satisfy them, but the reality is that only building a new life will give them what they’re truly looking for. A new car might look better than your old one, but only a new life can get you where you want to go.
The reality is I need a new me. And you need a new you.
Remember the glut of “makeover” TV shows? We still have quite a few today, but for a while it seemed like they were on every channel. One of those shows was Extreme Makeover. Here’s what they promised: “a real-life fairy tale in which their wishes come true, not just by changing their looks, but their lives and destinies.” They got one thing right: that is what we need! We need to change our lives and our destinies, but we can’t do that through plastic surgery, remodeling our homes, improving our wardrobes, or pimping our rides, no matter what our culture tells us.
God’s Image
What’s the reason for this longing we have?
I think it’s because we were made in God’s image. We were designed to live our lives reflecting who he is. That’s why we get so frustrated by our bad choices and bad habits, the things that drag us down, make us mistreat people, and stress us out. We know we were intended for better, but somehow we’ve messed things up. And something inside us screams, “I want to be made new!”
And the good news is that we can be. Here’s the promise we have from God: “Anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!”[1]
If a person makes the decision to belong to Jesus, that person is made new. The old is gone; the new has come.
That should fill you with hope. You can be made new! You can be transformed! You’re not stuck! You can change! You don’t have to live forever the way you are now!
God wants to make you new. He wants you to be like him.
The good news of the Bible is that God loves you not as you should be, but just the way you are. The great news is that God loves you too much to leave you as you are, because there’s something so much better for you. He wants to help you be who you should be, the new you you’ve longed to be.
Jesus lived a perfect life—a life of joy and happiness, a life beyond fear and worry, a life of love and compassion, a life without sin and selfishness. He was pure, peaceful, and purpose driven. He had an unmatched intimacy with God. While God isn’t asking you to stop being you, he does want you to be a new you, a new you that is just like Jesus. The Bible says that as we live out our new identity, we’ll see character traits like “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control”[2] growing in our lives.
A Confused Butterfly
Maybe you’ve become a Christian, but you don’t seem to be becoming more like Jesus. The new you seems a lot like the old you. What’s up with that?
I think the problem for some of us is that we don’t understand the promise God has made us. Since we don’t understand that we have a new identity, we’re still living out our old one.
Imagine a caterpillar. This caterpillar is crawling around in the dirt. Why? Because that’s what caterpillars do. But then this caterpillar goes through an incredible transformation in which it becomes something brand new: a butterfly. It’s a new creation. The old life is gone. The new life has begun. Now that it’s a butterfly, it can take flight and soar through the air. But I want you to imagine this butterfly . . . crawling around in the dirt. What kind of butterfly would crawl around in the dirt? Well, I guess only one who didn’t realize it was a butterfly. A butterfly who thought it was still a caterpillar would continue to crawl in the dirt.
And I wonder if the reason you aren’t living up to God’s promise of you being a new person in Christ is because you don’t understand your new identity. You’re a new person, but you still think you’re the old person. So you still find yourself crawling in the dirt, when you are capable of taking flight.
Understand this: if you’ve become a Christian, even if you are still struggling with your old ways, your old habits, your old sins, that is not the real you anymore.
The apostle Paul struggled with living the same old way even after he became a brand-new person. He writes about it in Romans 7. And what he concludes is interesting and important. He writes, “Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.”[3]
Did you notice the distinction Paul makes? He’s saying, “I know I’m struggling. I know that this sin is in me. But it is not me. I am a new person. I may struggle with things from my past, but I am not my past.”
And you are not your past. You are not your sin. Sin is no longer the truest thing about you.
You are a new person.
God has made you a brand-new you.
• • •
Now What?
Read 2 Corinthians 3:18.
As a Christ follower, you have a new identity. Your new identity is Jesus’ identity, and it should be becoming a reality in your life “more and more.” What could help you to remember and stay focused on your identity so you can live it out?
We often get stuck thinking of ourselves the way we’ve always thought of ourselves. Ask God to show you the old identity you maybe haven’t let go of yet and to help you believe you really are new in Christ.

PERJAMUAN PERKAWINAN RAJA- Bagian 1


Kasih Sang Raja

Ia menyuruh pula hamba-hamba lain, pesannya: Katakanlah kepada orang-orang yang diundang itu: Sesungguhnya hidangan, telah kusediakan, lembu-lembu jantan dan ternak piaraanku telah disembelih; semuanya telah tersedia, datanglah ke perjamuan kawin ini.
Matius 22:4

Lihatlah Allah yang mengasihi itu dalam raja yang mempersiapkan perjamuan kawin. Bagaimana kita dapat melihat kasihNya itu dalam perumpamaan ini? Pertama, Raja itu mengutus para hambanya. Ini adalah undangan hidup karena disampaikan oleh hamba² raja ini kepada orang² yang diundangnya. Pengutusan para hamba ini adalah sebuah perhatian besar dari sang raja. Para hamba raja itu harus memastikan pesan itu didengar setiap orang secara individu.
Selain itu lihat bagaimana raja itu menyiapkan hidangan, menyembelih lembu jantan dan ternaknya bagi perjamuan ini. Kemurahan hati raja diekspresikan dalam perjamuaan ini. Kasih raja itu dinyatakan dalam suguhan hidangan terbaik melalui lembu² jantan dan ternak² piaraan raja sendiri yang dirawat dengan baik. Anugerah raja dibuka selebar-lebarnya untuk semua dalam hidangan ini.
Yang utama dalam perjamuan ini adalah kehadiran dan kesediaan raja duduk makan sehidangan dengan para tamu yang diundangnya. Duduk sehidangan dengan seorang raja adalah sebuah kehormatan tanpa tandingan.
Ini adalah gambaran kasih, kemurahatian, dan anugerah Allah. Allah yang mengundang perjamuan kawin ini adalah Allah yang mampu dan mau menerima orang yg diundangNya itu untuk menikmati sukacita, kasih dan anugerah Allah dengan tangan yang terbuka.
Itu gambaran kehidupan dalam anugerah Kristus. Berlimpah oleh kasih karunia dari Allah yang memberi anugerah keselamatan kepada orang-orang berdosa seperti kita. Kita diizinkan duduk sehidangan dengan Raja segala raja.
Inilah juga gambaran ibadah Kristen yaitu kita diundang dalam perjamuan anak domba Allah menerima darah dan tubuhNya. Meja perjamuan kudus itu adalah meja sang raja yang membuka diriNya, anugerahNya, dan kasihNya bagi semua yang datang mendekat kepada meja kristus. Apalagi engkau tunggu? Apa yang membuatmu tidak dapat datang ke perjamuan Allah yang mengasihi ini?

Kemunafikan dan Kecanduan Pujian
Kemunafikan dan Kecanduan Pujian
Matius 23:1-12

23:1 Maka berkatalah Yesus kepada orang banyak dan kepada murid-murid-Nya, kata-Nya: 23:2 “Ahli-ahli Taurat dan orang-orang Farisi telah menduduki kursi Musa. 3 Sebab itu turutilah dan lakukanlah segala sesuatu yang mereka ajarkan kepadamu, tetapi janganlah kamu turuti perbuatan-perbuatan mereka, karena mereka mengajarkannya tetapi tidak melakukannya. 4 Mereka mengikat beban-beban berat, lalu meletakkannya di atas bahu orang, tetapi mereka sendiri tidak mau menyentuhnya.

Kursi Musa adalah sebuah istilah bahwa mereka adalah pengajar hukum Taurat yang dipandang, tetapi mereka hanya mengajarkan tetapi tidak melakukannya. Itu adalah kemunafikan. Namun, bagaimana dengan apa yang diajarkan oleh Rabi Yesus? Kata beban ini berkaitan dengan Matius 11:30. Yesus memberikan beban yang ringan apa itu? Itu adalah iman. Petrus dan para rasul memutuskan untuk tidak mengenakan sunat sebagai sesuatu yang wajib bagi mereka yang bukan Yahudi untuk disunat dan menuruti hukum Musa. “9 Ia sama sekali tidak mengadakan perbedaan antara kita dengan mereka, sesudah Ia menyucikan hati mereka oleh iman. 10 Kalau demikian, mengapa kamu mau mencobai Allah dengan meletakkan pada tengkuk murid-murid itu suatu kuk, yang tidak dapat dipikul, baik oleh nenek moyang kita maupun oleh kita sendiri? (Acts 15:9-10 ITB)” Matius 5 jelas bahwa Yesuslah yang menggenapi semua hukum Taurat itu.

5 Semua pekerjaan yang mereka lakukan hanya dimaksud supaya dilihat orang; mereka memakai tali sembahyang yang lebar dan jumbai yang panjang; 6 mereka suka duduk di tempat terhormat dalam perjamuan dan di tempat terdepan di rumah ibadat; 7 mereka suka menerima penghormatan di pasar dan suka dipanggil Rabi.

Ayat 5-7 adalah mengenai ruang publik. Ketika seseorang tidak lagi menginginkan sikap hati yang didalam tetapi penampilan luar dan haus hormat, maka dia sedangkan tidak melayani Tuhan tetapi memuaskan dirinya dan menjadikan dirinya pemujaan banyak orang.
Gambaran yang dijelaskan oleh Yesus mengenai kemunafikan orang-orang Farisi begitu gamblang. Mengapa orang-orang Farisi menjadi orang yang munafik? Penghormatan itu adalah candu. J.T. O Donnel menuliskan “Sebagai sifat dasar manusia, kita menyukai perasaan disukai atau dipuji. Konsep ini sangat terbukti dengan betapa kita kecanduan media sosial. Tidak ada yang bisa menyangkal betapa senangnya rasanya ketika kita melihat seseorang menyukai postingan kita atau memberikan komentar positif. Aktivitas tersebut menyebabkan otak kita memproduksi dopamin yang membuat kita merasakan kesenangan yang membuat ketagihan.” Kecanduan inilah yang menuntun banyak orang melakukan pekerjaan karena haus atau kecanduan pujian. Sebuah penelitian terbaru oleh J.T. O’Donnel menunjukkan bahwa lebih dari 70% orang akan menjawab tidak untuk pertanyaan tersebut. Dengan kata lain, mereka merasa karier yang mereka miliki tidak sesuai dengan apa yang seharusnya mereka lakukan. Mereka merasakan ketidakpuasan yang berujung pada menurunnya tingkat kebahagiaan dalam hal pekerjaan profesional mereka. Kesalahan nomor satu adalah ketika kita memilih karir berdasarkan apa yang bisa menyenangkan orang lain atau membuat orang lain terkesan. Belum lagi jika orang-orang tersebut tidak benar-benar layak untuk dibuat terkesan. Namun, membuat orang tua Anda bangga adalah tindakan yang mulia dan keduanya tidak harus saling bertentangan.

8 Tetapi kamu, janganlah kamu disebut Rabi; karena hanya satu Rabimu dan kamu semua adalah saudara. 9 Dan janganlah kamu menyebut siapapun bapa di bumi ini, karena hanya satu Bapamu, yaitu Dia yang di sorga. 23:10 Janganlah pula kamu disebut pemimpin, karena hanya satu Pemimpinmu, yaitu Mesias. 11 Barangsiapa terbesar di antara kamu, hendaklah ia menjadi pelayanmu. 12 Dan barangsiapa meninggikan diri, ia akan direndahkan dan barangsiapa merendahkan diri, ia akan ditinggikan.

Banyak yang berpendapat bahwa Yesus melarang memanggil semua orang sebagai bapa atau menyangkali peran seorang bapa. Perkataan Yesus ini tidak bisa dilihat sepenggal-penggal tetapi harus secara keseluruhan terutama dengan ayat 11 dan 12. Perhatikan bagaimana dia menggunakan gelar-gelar yang dihormati, yaitu Rabi, Bapa (kemungkinan berasal dari Matius 3:9, merujuk klaim Abraham sebagai bapa orang-orang farisi yang munafik), dan Pemimpin (merujuk kepada Musa karena mereka menduduki kursi Musa) dengan menggunakan kata “jangan”. Ini juga bukan berarti bahwa pendeta tidak boleh dipanggil Pendeta, Bapa, Pemimpin atau Guru Besar, karena Yesus sedang membicarakan motif hati yang membanggakan diri, bukan masalah sebutannya.
Yesus sedang mengantisipasi keinginan-keinginan hati yang ada dalam diri para murid-Nya untuk menjadi seperti orang-orang Farisi dan ahli-ahli Taurat dengan negasi negatif “jangan”. Setelah menegasikan sebuah sebuatan itu, lalu dia menekankan mengenai menjadi pelayan. Yang terbesar diantara kamu harus menjadi pelayanmu. Jadi yang harus dikejar adalah bukan sebutan-sebutan rabi, bapa, dan pemimpin tetapi sikap yang merendahkan hati atau melayani sesama saudara. Melihat diri sebagai sesama saudara yang saling melayani bukan menguasai, menaklukkan atau pun memaksa tetapi saling merendahkan diri.
Kemunafikan akan menuntun kepada self destruction. Bukan hanya karena kita sedang melakukan sebuah kebohongan tetapi kita sedang berusaha memecah diri kita menjadi dua pribadi yang berbeda. Kondisi ini sangat menyiksa karena kita akan menuntun kita kepada krisis diri. Kita bisa bercermin dengan film The Queen’s Gambit.
“[Film ini mengisahkan mengenai] Elizabeth Harmon seorang anak yatim piatu yang banyak menghabiskan waktunya di panti asuhan dengan bermain catur. Diajarkan oleh seorang tukang bersih-bersih di panti asuhannya, karakter yang dikenal dengan sebutan Beth ini akhirnya menjadi mahir bermain catur.

GOD HAS COME FOR US

Day 3

Christ is the visible image of the invisible God. He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation.

COLOSSIANS 1:15

WHEN MY KIDS WERE YOUNGER, they wanted a pet. We said no. They begged for a pet. We told them we love other people’s pets.

Finally we caved, but not much. We bought each kid a goldfish. Our son, Dawson, who was five at the time, named his Darth Fishy. Our daughter, Marissa, who was about to turn three, named hers Mackenzie.

We got home, dropped the fish in their tanks, and put the tanks on the shelf. The kids looked at them, looked at us, looked at them, looked at us, and walked away to watch TV. So much for the excitement of having pets.

Later Marissa said, “A fish isn’t a very good pet.” I asked why, and she explained, “Because you can’t really love it, and it doesn’t really love you back.”

“Well,” I tried to encourage her, “you can sort of love it.”

Around that time we started to notice Mackenzie’s tank always had dirtier water than Darth Fishy’s. We couldn’t understand it, until I walked in one day and found Marissa . . . petting her fish. Wanting to show her fish love, turns out she was trying to pet it a few times a day.

Her fish didn’t like it. In fact, her fish would panic and try to get away from the gigantic hand.

I wondered if maybe at night, after we all went to sleep, her fish would get out its diary and write, “It happened again today. It was a normal day, intermittent light, 72 degrees, pink gravel beneath me. I was trying to decide, should I swim towards the surface or bottom, swim right or left, when suddenly it appeared—the shadow. The shadow is always the first sign that it’s coming. Then it arrived, five enormous protruding limbs and a meaty paw trying to crush me. But I will not be destroyed by it! I did everything I could to get away! It did trap me in a corner and touch me, but only for a second. Then from somewhere in the heavens, I heard a thundering noise.”

And the thundering noise was, of course, Marissa yelling, “Daddy, I just petted my fish!”

Resistant to Love
Have you ever thought about what it’s like to be God? The Bible tells us that God is love and created us in love and for love.

But very quickly there was a problem in God’s creation: these humans were resistant to love, and they didn’t do well at loving God back. It wasn’t so much that they didn’t want love, because they did. But much of the time they didn’t recognize it; much of the time they tried to get away from it.

All through the Old Testament we see God trying to share his love with people, and consistently people running from God and rejecting his love. In the last book of the Old Testament God says, “I have always loved you,” then, “But you retort, ‘Really? How have you loved us?’”[1]

I can imagine God thinking, How have I loved you? I’ve done everything for you! How else could I love you? What can I do to get you to accept my love?

And it was almost as if God had an idea.[2]

God Came for Us
Watching my daughter try to love her fish, I felt so bad for her. She just wanted to show love, but no matter what she did, her fish would not accept it as love. She would try to pet the fish, and it would run away as if Freddy Krueger were after it. There was just no way for Marissa to connect with and communicate love to her fish.

But what if there were some way for Marissa to get in the tank? If she could somehow become a fish, she could show her fish love in a way it could understand. That might actually work.

God’s idea was to get in the tank. To become like the ones he loved, so he could communicate his love.

This is described in the book of John, where Jesus is referred to as “the Word.” The book of John begins by explaining that Jesus was with God and was God from the beginning: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”[3]

And then God jumped into the tank. “The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.”[4] Jesus left heaven to come to the world.

Another passage in the Bible describes it this way: “Though he was God, he did not think of equality with God as something to cling to. Instead, he gave up his divine privileges; he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being. . . . He appeared in human form.”[5]

God became one of us. So when we look at Jesus, we see God. Jesus is exactly God and exactly what God is like. The Bible says “Christ is the visible image of the invisible God”[6] and “the Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being.”[7]

That is kind of ironic, because some people say, “Yeah, I’ve read the Bible, and I like Jesus, but I don’t like the God of the Old Testament.” But they’re actually exactly the same.

So why does there seem to be such a difference?

Well, why was Marissa’s fish scared of her? Why, when Marissa put her hand in to pet her fish, did her fish flee as if its life were in danger? Because Marissa was just too big, too different, too above her fish for her fish to understand her love.

If Marissa could have gone into her tank as a fish and snuggled a little, maybe her fish would have understood her love. Her love wouldn’t be any different; it would just be on a level her fish could understand.

Why did God become one of us? “God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son.”[8] Jesus came because of God’s love and to express God’s love.

Murder in the Fish Degree
Think about this: What if Marissa became a fish and got in the bowl, but her fish didn’t snuggle up and love her back? What if her fish killed her?

That’s exactly what happened to Jesus. He got into our skin, came to the world, and the people he came to love killed him.

But that was part of God’s plan as well.

It was part of God’s plan, because God created us in love and for love. We exist to be in relationship with God. But we’ve all walked away from that relationship, and God had to create a way to bring us back to him. Jesus said, “I am the way.”[9] God had to create a bridge to span the gap between us. Jesus is that bridge. God had to do something about the sin that stains us and separates us from a perfectly pure God. The Bible says that Jesus became sin for us and did away with all of our sin on the cross. It was all part of God’s plan, because God created us in love and for love. And Jesus’ coming and dying was the only way we could be in relationship with him.

Now What?
Read Philippians 2:6-11.
This passage describes the descent Jesus made from heaven to earth to the cross. What do you find in these verses to be thankful for? What do you find in Jesus that you should emulate?
Thank God for Jesus. Thank him that Jesus was humble enough to become a human and loved you enough to die for you.

GOD IS THE STAR

Everything comes from him and exists by his power and is intended for his glory. All glory to him forever! Amen.
ROMANS 11:36
A FEW YEARS AGO I SAW A MOVIE where the main character says he feels like life is a movie, and he’s the star of it.[1] Everyone else—his neighbors, coworkers, family members, the waitress at the restaurant—are just supporting actors making occasional cameo appearances in the movie about his life.
The idea would be kind of clever and funny if it didn’t hit so close to home.
Do you feel like the star of your story? Does it seem like your family and friends have been included in it to support you? And the waitress and garbage man and grocery clerk exist to serve you?
We would never say it like that, but most people think that way. And can I suggest it’s why most people go through life mostly sad?
There’s a little problem with the way we tend to think.
It’s all wrong.
Life is a story, but it’s not about you.
God is the star of the story.
Life: Starring God
It’s all about God.
If you kind of think of yourself as the center of the universe, this idea will bother you, but it’s all about God.
It’s always been all about God. In fact, in the beginning, there was only God. Now don’t picture God being lonely, because he wasn’t. As I’ve mentioned, God has always existed in perfect community. He is three, yet one. The word Trinity is often used to describe this idea. God is three distinct beings who live in such tight-knit, loving, bonded community that they exist as only one being, one God. One God made up of three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
God is the star. And somehow, despite being God, God is so humble that each member of the Trinity tries to make the others the stars. We see God the Father glorifying his Son Jesus.[2] We see Jesus glorifying his Father.[3] We see the Holy Spirit of God glorifying God the Son.[4] God is so humble that each member of the Trinity tries to defer glory to the other members of the Trinity. But make no mistake, God is the star of the story.
And God decided to create. He created a universe, an earth. Why? “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.”[5] The creation glorifies the Creator. Nature points to God, because he is the star of the story.
God also decided to create people. Why? God says, “I have made them for my glory.”[6] In fact, we’re commanded, “Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.”[7] And we’re given this blessing: “May you always be filled with the fruit of your salvation—the righteous character produced in your life by Jesus Christ—for this will bring much glory and praise to God.”[8] We exist to glorify God. We’re to point our lives at him and honor him as the star of the story.
Who Will Be the Star of Your Story?
So the question you and I have to answer, not just one initial time, but a thousand times every day, is: Who will be the star of my story? Will I live my life and make decisions to try to glorify myself, or will I seek to bring glory to God in everything I do?
You may think living your life for God’s pleasure instead of for your desires might lead you to a smaller life, but exactly the opposite will happen. Your life will be so much bigger and so much better.
In his book Disciple: Getting Your Identity from Jesus, Bill Clem gives a great illustration of this:
Imagine two drama students, each with a dream of making it big as an actress.
One day the first drama student comes up with a plan. She decides to create her own play with a starring role for herself. Though she’s never written, she starts working on a script. Once it’s completed, realizing that she can’t afford to pay other actors, she enlists two of her friends to take the other roles. She doesn’t have money to rent a venue or create staging, so she talks her parents into allowing the play to be performed in their garage.
The second drama student auditions for a small part in a big Broadway play in New York. She gets the part. It’s a minor role, but she’ll be working with some of the best actors, acting coaches, directors, and producers in the industry, and an outstanding playwright wrote the script.
Which student do you think will have the more significant experience? My money is on the one in the Broadway play: she may have a small role, but she is part of something much bigger than she could ever hope to create on her own. The girl in the garage, on the other hand, is trying to convince herself that she’s constructed something worth being a part of. But, in reality, she has constricted herself to a very small story played out in a very small setting.
When you choose to live your own story, it’s very small. Because you are the star of it, you may think it’s a big deal, but it’s really not.
But when you choose to find yourself in God’s story and make him the star of it, you become a part of something huge. Your life will be, and it will feel, much bigger and more important, because you’re no longer the most important person in the story.
Are You Sure God Is the Star?
Some people choose to construct and live out their own stories. Then at some point they invite God into their stories. They’ll tell you, “I invited Jesus into my life.” But honestly, the way they live their lives reveals that it’s still their story.
God’s not proposing that we invite him into our lives. He’s asking us to give him our lives. We surrender our lives to God’s will and to living for his glory. We say, “I want to be a part of God’s story. And even if I just get a bit part, that’s okay, because I’m still part of the BIG story. Because pleasing and bringing glory to God is the most significant thing I can experience, that’s what I want to do with my life.”
• • •
Now What?
Read Colossians 3:1-17.
How does this passage describe a life lived for God’s glory? What do you think would need to change for your life to better point to and glorify God as the star of the story?
Tell God that he is the star of your story. Admit to him your fears about that and the ways you feel inadequate to actually live that way. Ask him for help!

Hypocrisy and Praise Addiction

Hypocrisy and Praise Addiction
Matthew 23:1-12


“Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, 2 “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat, 3 so do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do. For they preach, but do not practice. 4 They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear,[a] and lay them on people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger.”

The seat of Moses is a term that they are teachers of the Law seen, but to only teach but do is hypocrisy. What about what Rabbi Jesus taught? The word burden is related to Matthew 11:30. Jesus gave a light burden what is it? It is faith. Peter and the apostles decided not to impose circumcision as it was mandatory for those who were not Jews to be circumcised and obey the law of Moses. “9 He made no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith. 10 Why then do you want to tempt God by putting a yoke on the disciples’ neck, which neither our fathers nor we ourselves could bear?” (Acts 15:9-10 ITB) Matthew 5 is clear that Jesus is the fulfilment of the law.

“5 They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, 6 and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues 7 and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi[b] by others.”

Verses 5-7 are about the public space. When one no longer desires an inward heart attitude but an outward appearance and thirsts for honour, then he is meanwhile not serving God but gratifying himself and making himself the idol of many.
Jesus’ description of the Pharisees’ hypocrisy is very clear. Why did the Pharisees become hypocrites? Honor is like an opiate. J.T. O Donnel wrote, “As a matter of human nature, we like the feeling of being liked or praised. This concept is very evident in how addicted we are to social media. No one can deny how good it feels when we see someone like our post or leave a positive comment. The activity causes our brain to produce dopamine, which makes us feel an addictive pleasure.” It is this addiction that leads many people to do work out of thirst or addiction to praise. A recent study by J.T. O’Donnel showed that more than 70% of people would answer no to the question. In other words, they feel that the career they have is not what they should be doing. They feel a sense of dissatisfaction that leads to lower levels of happiness when it comes to their professional work. The number one mistake is when we choose our careers based on what will please others or impress others. Not to mention, if those people don’t really deserve to be impressed. However, making your parents proud is a noble act, and the two don’t have to contradict each other.”

“8 But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers.[c] 9 And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. 10 Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. 11 The greatest among you shall be your servant. 12 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”

Many argue that Jesus forbids calling everyone father or denying the role of a father. Notice how he uses the honored titles of Rabbi, Father (possibly from Matthew 3:9, referring to Abraham’s claim to be the father of the hypocritical Pharisees), and Leader (referring to Moses because they occupied Moses’ seat) by using the word “do not”. This is also not to say that pastors should not be called Pastor, Father, Leader or Professor, because Jesus was talking about the motive of a proud heart, not the designation.
Jesus was anticipating the inner desires of His disciples to be like the Pharisees and scribes with the negative negation “do not”. Having negated such a charge, he then emphasized being a servant. The greatest among you should be your servant. So what should be pursued is not the titles of rabbi, father, and leader but the attitude of humbling or serving fellow brothers. Seeing yourselves as fellow brothers who serve one another, not dominating, conquering or coercing but humbling one another.
Hypocrisy leads to self-destruction. Not only because we are telling a lie, but we are trying to split ourselves into two different individuals. This condition is excruciating because we will lead ourselves to a self crisis. We can reflect on the film The Queen’s Gambit.
“[The film tells the story of] Elizabeth Harmon, an orphan who spends much of her time at the orphanage playing chess. Taught by a cleaner at the orphanage, the character known as Beth eventually became adept at playing chess. When she became a teenager and was eventually adopted by a couple, she had the opportunity to participate in various chess competitions. Beth always wins and always has to win. Without realizing it, Beth had entered into her addiction to winning. So when she had to lose, she experienced an identity crisis. Beth who had always been a winner suddenly ceased to be a winner. Gradually, she was confused to find out who she was outside of her victory. It was as if no one gave her validation for what she did. Especially when the adoptive mother who always accompanied her to compete died. Beth became more confused and eventually slowly damaged herself because she was again confused about her changing identity. From being an adopted child who had parents, she had to return to the identity of being a child without a family. Eventually, the confusion led her to self-destruction. He seeks a self-destructive escape as a sign of denial that he cannot face and accept the harsh reality. His ambition to be a winner becomes an obsession that leads to self-acceptance difficulties.”

Hypocrisy and praise addiction are closely related, and the result is self-destruction.

Journey to Emmaus with the Risen Christ
Why did the two disciples ask Jesus to stay?



I listened to two sermons that expounded on this journey to Emmaus. Both of the preachers concluded that the act of Jesus walking “as if he were going farther” was because Jesus didn’t force the disciples to know that He is Jesus who has raised up from the dead and He is the Messiah. Both of them gave good applications in their sermons, that Jesus didn’t impose himself to be recognized but He gave them a choice to choose. One of the preachers continues to expand this notion to the freewill status of a man. So both preachers show Christ’s character in a very gentle way. However, we only noticed what was happening inside the disciple’s hearts at the end of the story when they realized that the person who was talking with them was Jesus Christ. They said to each other “Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?” (v. 32). I think the main focus comes to play on the reason why the disciples asked Jesus to stay. Yes, agree that Jesus didn’t force people to decide yet Jesus’s expounding the scriptures was one of the means by which the disciple finally decided to have him stay with them. In other words, Jesus raised the authority of scripture to a level, and not only its become a relevant thing, but also it was the real thing. The scripture came alive through the messiah who fulfilled, that is Jesus Christ himself.
The big idea of Jesus’ explanation, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, throughout the scriptures, was that Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory. Jesus posed his main idea with a question “Was it not necessary that Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” Why? It was a way for the disciples to think and digest slowly what Jesus was going to explain from the Scriptures about himself. It was a way that tells us about the context of the passage and that what happened with Jesus of Nazareth was known by all people in Jerusalem. So they are discussing an issue that everyone knows about it. Moreover, the disciples discussed whether Jesus really raised from the dead but they didn’t see Him. That was the part where Jesus join the discussion and explained the Messiah in all the scriptures. Luke wrote, “While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. 17 He said to them, “What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?” And they stood still, looking sad. The disciples said, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” Jesus appeared in a physically resurrected body yet they didn’t recognize him. The disciples look sad and wonder whether Jesus was a visitor from outside Jerusalem. They were saying, “If you are in Jerusalem you will know about all things we are talking about”.
Jesus’s response to these disciples was not a pretending that he didn’t know what had happened, yet it was a clarification that referred to the main issue. Jesus asked them, “What things?”. He asked this to have a specific explanation of their own understanding regarding the issue. The disciples explained, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, 20 and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 21 But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. 22 Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, 23 and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 24 Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” In the explanation, the disciples have a military messiah hope but their hope was shattered when Jesus died. Yet they were all also confused about what had happened around the tomb, some women of their company saw angels and they didn’t find Jesus’s body. Their expectation of the Messiah was not fit with the reality they saw.
So there was a missing puzzle between what had happened to Jesus and how it fits with the Scriptures. Therefore Jesus said, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 26 Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” Jesus showed how foolish and slow their heart is to believe. This means that the disciple knows what the prophets had spoken yet they were slow to believe it. It also means that they were not in line with what the prophets believed. It was fascinating that Jesus use a rhetorical question to hint at his main idea. So the answer was that the Messiah need to suffer all these things and then enter his glory. Suffering was the road to glory for the Messiah. At this point, the disciples still haven’t grasped the depth of his words. That is why then Jesus explained that the Messiah was prophesied in the prophets beginning with Moses and all the rest of the scriptures (the Old Testament). This action was stunning because Jesus taught these two disciples the meaning of what the prophets were saying about the messiah. You can imagine that this is like a side-by-side translation process. This means they didn’t understand what the Scripture was saying. For them, it is like a foreign tongue that needs to be translated. Well, Jesus is the greatest interpreter of God because He is God, one being with the Father, who became a man. He is also the one who was prophesied by the prophets and all Scripture. So He knew well what he should be saying when he translated it.
The explanation is resulting in the disciples’ hearts burning while they are listening to Him. It was clear as day. The interpretation of “the foreign tongue” of the messiah prophecy was received very well by the foolish and slow hearts. Their hearts were burning. The word burning was used in Luke 12:35 in the context of keeping the lamps burning. The meaning in Luke 12:35 was to stay awake and wait for the master that will come. But Luke 24:32 related to the disciples’ foolishness and slowness of heart, which means that now their hearts were in a state where they can sense something more about the man who accompanied and explained what the Scriptures were all about. They realized, that their hearts were lighted up by Jesus’s explanation of the Scripture regarding the Messiah. I think at this moment they knew Messiah that was prophesied by the Scriptures fits what had happened to Jesus. Their mind and hearts begin to see the clear picture of the Messiah (remember these disciples were slow in heart). And I think now they knew Jesus was the Messiah who was prophesied by the prophets and all the Scriptures. But they hadn’t recognized that the man they were talking to was Jesus, himself. That is why they asked Jesus to stay with him not only because it was getting dark but because they felt there was something about this man.
So Yes Jesus was gentle and didn’t impose His thought yet He did use the authority of the Scriptures and explained it to the disciples. At this point we can hear the echo of this authority from the Gospel of John 6:43-46 “Jesus replied, “Do not complain about me to one another.44 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. 45 It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who hears and learns from the Father comes to me.” So the Father through the Scriptures drew these disciples and made their hearts lighted up. And the most important part is that when it is said “they will all be taught by God” Jesus, who is God, one being with God the Father taught these two disciples. The authority of the scriptures that was taught by Jesus made these two disciples’s burning even though Jesus didn’t impose anything. We may ask why Jesus seems as if he is going to continue his journey? Well, we can answer it like this that Jesus is wanting to see how far the disciples’ understanding is. If they recognize Him at that moment He will leave them. Why I know that Jesus will leave them if they recognize him at that moment? because this also was the case when they finally recognized Him at the end. But it seemed that the disciples had not yet come into full recognition of Him, so he stayed with them for a little longer.
The communion was the vivid moment when all what Jesus had said and the memory of the disciples finally built and lit up their awareness, to recognize Jesus is the man who became their traveling companion. Here we knew that Jesus reclined to the table and he immediately took, blessed, broke and gave the bread to them. Wait, who brought the bread? Here Jesus played the role as the head of a household. In jewish household tradition the head of the household is the one incharge to breaking the bread. It was taught in Talmud, it say, “Our Rabbis taught: A man should not break bread for visitors unless he eats with them, but he may break bread for his children and the members of his household so as to train them in the performance of religious duties. I.e., recite the blessing. Talmud – Mas. Rosh HaShana 29b” So Jesus most possibly was the one who brought the bread. In the Gospel of John, we can see the resurrected Christ provided bread and fish for the disciples. It was in John 21: 9 “When they got out on the beach, they saw a charcoal fire ready with a fish placed on it, and bread.” They ate together. This also showed how He confidently performed the breaking of the bread for these disciples. This act of breaking of the bread was the eyes opening moment for these disciples. It opened up their hearts and the veil fell off and they suddenly saw it was Jesus. They were not just seen but believed it was Jesus who had been raised from the dead, the prophesied Messiah. They might remember what Jesus had said about the bread that broke off was His body. Why did the disciples finally realize it was Jesus who broke the bread? Well, the suffering Messiah was clear to them. Jesus’ death was clear to them. But now there is someone who took, bless, break and give the bread in the same way Jesus did. The Scripture explanation came together with what Jesus’ life has displayed. Through the ministry of the word and the breaking of the bread that prophesied Messiah has been displayed in Jesus Christ fully. In another word, it all displayed Christ’s full screen picture to their minds and hearts. A suffering yet glorious messiah who was raised from the dead, who is Jesus Christ himself.
Yes Jesus didn’t impose yet His power in his words and the communion brought these disciples to the full recognition of Christ. His words irresistible and His communion unveiled the darkness of hearts.

Thomas, The Didymus

Who is the twin in the Gospel of John?


Begins with John 11:16, “So Thomas called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.” This verse was the first appearence of Thomas in the Gospel of John. Thomas is depicted as pessimistic. He was doubting that Jesus’s visit would not change anything, Lazarus died and was not asleep; this was also reflected by other disciples. But Thomas added a very sarcastic statement. He picked up Jesus’s line that said “…let us go to him”, which referred to Lazarus. He changed it into “Let us also go to die with Him”, which referred to Jesus, the context was mentioned in verse 8, “the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?”. So Thomas reflected on the disciples’ doubt about going to Judea because the Jews wanted to stone Jesus and Lazarus was dead, not asleep.
The second appearance of Thomas was in John 14:5, “Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” This verse as well depicting Thomas’s doubt about what Jesus has said. Jesus said, ”And you know the way to where I am going.” He was the representative of the disciples because he used the word “we”. So Thomas’s doubting question to Jesus’ statement was from the whole disciples’ point of view. The disciples were in doubt about what way Jesus spoke of. Philip as well reflecting doubt in a different way, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” What Philip was saying was, until you show us the Father, we will not have enough.
The third appearance, the pivotal moment, of Thomas was in the second gathering, or the second Sunday after the Sunday resurrection of Jesus. John 20:24 mentioned Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus was not with all the rest of the disciples, at the first appearance to the almost whole disciples, minus Thomas. They all saw Jesus. Jesus said, “Peace be with you” and after saying that, he showed them his hands and side. So they told Thomas what they saw at the second gathering. They said, “We have seen the Lord”. However, we must notice that the disciples were not convinced fully by the evidence of the empty tomb, that Jesus has risen from the grave. They did believe that Mary Magdalene was true, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” So the disciples left the tomb and went home because they didn’t understand the scripture (John 20:8-10).
It was reasonable when Jesus came to the disciples through the locked doors and showed his hands and side. Jesus came to the disciples because he want them to realize that He has risen. Mary Magdalene clung to Jesus’s resurrected body, and that is what Jesus said, “Do not cling to me…” (in Matthew Mary hold Jesus’s feet and worshiped him) Mary has proven Jesus had risen physically. Mary came to the first gathering and meet the disciples, minus Thomas, saying “I’ve seen the Lord”. Now the disciple didn’t respond to Mary’s statement till Jesus appeared to them showing them his hands and side. After the first gathering, and the second gathering, the disciples who saw Jesus at the first gathering said to Thomas, “We have seen the Lord”. So now they testify as the whole community, that they have seen the Lord with their own eyes, and heard him with their own ears, and possibly touched him with their own hands.

Thomas was “the twin” of the rest of the disciples’ doubting minds. If we noticed there was no recorded information that we can point out, who is the twin of Thomas? We are only left by the doubting record of the rest of the disciples. It begins with John 11:16, 14:5 and it was revealed that Thomas’s twin was the rest of the disciples, in John 20:26-28. So Thomas played the doubting character in the Gospel of John, who was convinced at the end of chapter 20 as a punchline for the purpose of the Gospel of John. However, in chapter 21, we also saw how the disciple didn’t recognise immediately the man who was with them at the shore of Tiberius. After they caught many fishes by a miracle, John the beloved disciple pointed out that the man is Jesus, and then Peter swam to Jesus. And all the rest of the disciples recognize him too. They had close physical contact with Jesus by eating fish and bread.
The resurrection story ended with this line “This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.” (John 21:15). Jesus’ appearance had its climax when they ate the shore of Tiberius. From chapter 21:16-3 was talking about Peter and John and none mentioned again Thomas, who was called Didymus. Why is that so? Because the twin of Thomas was the rest of the disciples had been convinced that Jesus was physically from the dead. No more twin Thomas. They are all united with one accord that Jesus now has risen.
Now, the question was why the Gospel of John didn’t directly point out that the twin brothers of Thomas were the rest of the disciples. Well, the Gospel of John was narrative in the genre. The naming of Thomas, who was called Didymus, was intentionally used by John to open up the reader’s possibility doubts. He invited the readers who have doubts about Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection to identify themselves with Thomas and the rest of the disciples. If I may say, the “twin brothers” of Thomas can be you, the readers, or those who haven’t seen Jesus’ resurrection body in person, yet through this gospel, the author wants you to have close contact with Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection. So that through this gospel you might be believed as the disciples also believed. You are the twins of Thomas’s brother in doubting minds.
You don’t need to go through what Thomas and the rest of the disciples have been through, in order to believe Jesus as the savior. Through the Gospel of John, all the details of Jesus’s resurrection were expounded and brought together. You didn’t need to go through the tomb to check Jesus’s empty tomb and the locked door and experience the fears of the Jews. You don’t need to wait until you see Jesus’ resurrected body. Why? Because the disciples experienced it for you and they wrote all the facts and brought it all to you, to be read so you can believe. Jesus said, “Happy are they who didn’t see but believe.” In the Gospel of John, we can find the healing of a man born blind. He believed what Jesus told him and when he act upon Jesus’ words, he was healed from his blindness. In another word, faith did not rely on sight alone. The Gospel brought the idea that Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection can bring faith to those who read and heard it. Faith was supernatural that was brought by the Holy Spirit. Jesus said in his conversation with Nicodemus that the man who was born by the Spirit was called born from above or of the Spirit not of man (John 1:12). He also said those who believed in Him were drawn close by the Father.

Zacchaeus : the Chief of Sinners
Interesting little info that is often overlooked. Zacchaeus was no ordinary tax collector. He’s the chief tax collector. He has subordinates under him. He was responsible for all reports of tax collection from his subordinates to the Roman empire. If even a tax collector was hated by the Jews, how much more was this Zacchaeus. The tax collector was regarded not only as a traitor or robber of his own nation but also as a sinner in the category of the Jews. That means Zacchaeus is the chief of sinners. In verse 7 it says:
7 And when the people saw it, they all complained, *“He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”*

If Jesus came looking for “the most sinner of sinners” and saved “the most sinner”.
In verse 10 it is written:
10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.” This is a continuation of the theme of the lost lamb, coin and youngest and eldest son.

If the prodigal son is the youngest running for pleasure and worldly satisfaction. His father ran to him and hugged him. If the prodigal son asked for wealth from his father to spend on himself, Zacchaeus gave half of his property to someone else and paid 4 times what he had extorted.

All this happened when Jesus came to stay at his house. Interestingly, Jesus did not say anything about what would normally be considered “spiritual”. He just said *”Zaccheus, hurry down, because today I have to stay at your house.”* Of course Jesus knew who Zacchaeus was, didn’t give any theological argument verbally that God loves and seeks sinners but he immediately showed his argument through his actions.


It was through this action that Zacchaeus realized that God’s love had reached him, so that he could joyfully accept Jesus and give away his treasure.

He is no longer Zacchaeus who pursues wealth as his ultimate goal but now he sees wealth as a means to love God and others.
What a story!!!!

Following Jesus Christ
11 And when they had brought their boats ashore, they also left everything and followed Jesus. Luke 5:11

Simon Peter, James and John were no ordinary fishermen. They are experienced fishermen. They are not fishermen just starting their job. They know when the time is right the fish will appear and are easy to catch. They also know what kind of places fish like to congregate. They have known for a long time.

But this was the day they didn’t get any fish. I’m sure they’ve tried to the best of their ability. All their skills are used to catch fish. But unfortunately, they didn’t catch a single fish. until at last they gave up, got out of the boat and washed the nets. With their heads down and shoulders down they stopped fishing. Stop because their efforts are fruitless. Their skills are barren.

Until finally Jesus came and began to teach the people in Simon Peter’s boat and He asked him to turn his boat into a deep place and scatter his nets. Peter confirmed to Him that they had worked hard all night but the result was ZERO. But because Jesus told him to, someone he considered a rabbi/teacher because he was reluctant, he did it. I don’t know what was going through Peter’s mind when he did what Jesus told him to do. But of course it would not be easy for Peter to do so. Because Peter was a fisherman while Jesus was a rabbi/teacher not a fisherman. Peter might also have thought that Jesus wanted to use the illustration of his fishing as his teaching tool? so he did. But whatever the reason Peter did what Jesus told him to do.

Miracles happen. The net caught a large number of fish and began to tear. We can imagines, from an empty net without fish, now the net was full of fish so that it began to tear holding so many fish. it is not a coincidence but a real miracle showing that Jesus is in power. Peter realized this so that he said: “Stay away from me for I am a sinner.” This is not an ordinary confession but a serious and no joke. He witnessed for himself how just by following Jesus’ instructions he caught a large number of fish and the nets began to tear and even the boat almost sank because of so many fish. Peter realized that Jesus was not an ordinary man. After Jesus’ resurrection, he fully realized that Jesus is God.

However, what was more interesting was that when they had caught the fish they left everything behind and followed Jesus. they don’t enjoy their success and cheer themselves up because they have caught so many fish. But they left him. This is proof that they are not oriented towards miracles that happen but they are enabled by God to see who Jesus Christ is. They realized that the call to follow Jesus was more important than just enjoying success and miracles.

Have we followed Him with all our hearts?

Mengikuti Yesus Kristus
11 Dan sesudah mereka menghela perahu-perahunya ke darat, merekapun meninggalkan segala sesuatu, lalu mengikut Yesus. Lukas 5 :11

Simon Petrus, Yakobus dan Yohanes bukan nelayan biasa. Mereka nelayan² yang berpengalaman menangkap ikan. Mereka bukan nelayan yang baru memulai pekerjaan mereka. Mereka tahu kapan waktu yang tepat ikan² akan muncul dan mudah ditangkap. Mereka pun tahu tempat seperti apa yang disukai ikan untuk berkumpul. Sudah lama mereka tahu caranya.

Tapi inilah harinya mereka tidak mendapatkan ikan sekalipun. Saya sangat yakin mereka sudah berusaha dengan segala kemampuan mereka. Seluruh keahlian mereka dipakai untuk menangkap ikan. Tapi sayangnya, tidak satu pun ikan yang mereka tangkap. sampai pada akhirnya mereka menyerah, turun dari perahu dan membasuh jalanya. Dengan kepala yang tertunduk dan bahu ya ng turun mereka berhenti menjala ikan. Berhenti karena usaha mereka tidak membuahkan hasil. Keahlian mereka mandul.

Sampai akhirnya Yesus datang dan mulai mengajar banyak orang di perahu Simon Petrus dan Dia memintanya untuk menolakkan perahunya ke tempat yang dalam dan menebarkan jalanya. Petrus menegaskan kepadaNya bahwa mereka sudah kerja keras sepanjang malam tapi hasilnya NOL. Tetapi karena Yesus yang suruh, seorang yang dianggapnya sebagai rabi/guru karena ada sungkan, maka dia melakukannya. Entah apa yang ada dalam pikiran Petrus ketika dia melakukan apa yang diperintahkan Yesus. Tetapi tentu tidak akan mudah bagi Petrus melakukaannya. Karena Petrus nelayan sedangkan Yesus adalah rabi / guru bukan nelayan. Petrus mungkin juga berpikir bahwa Yesus ingin menggunakan ilustrasi penangkapan ikannya itu sebagai alat ajarnya? sehingga dia melakukannya. Tetapi apapun alasannya Petrus melakukan apa yang Yesus perintahkan.

Mukjizat terjadi. Jala itu menangkap sejumlah besar ikan dan mulai koyak. Bisa dibayangkan. Dari jala yang kosong tanpa ikan kini jala itu penuh ikan sehingga mulai koyak menahan ikan yang begitu banyak. itu bukan sebuah kebetulan tetapi sebuah mukjizat yang nyata menunjukkan bahwa Yesus berkuasa. hal ini disadari Petrus sehingga dia berkata :”menjauhlah dari padaku karena aku ini seorang berdosa” Ini bukan sebuah pengakuan biasa tetapi pengakuan serius dan tidak main². Petrus menyaksikan sendiri bagaimana hanya dengan mengikuti instruksi Yesus, dia menangkap sejumlah besar ikan dan jalanya mulai koyak dan bahkan perahunya hampir tenggelam karena begitu banyaknya ikan. Petrus sadar bahwa Yesus bukan manusia biasa. Setelah kebangkitan Yesus, ia baru menyadari sepenuhnya bahwa Yesus adalah Tuhan juga. Yesus memiliki dua natur: manusia dan Tuhan sejati.

Namun, yang lebih menarik adalah ketika mereka sudah mendapatkan ikan, mereka meninggalkan semuanya itu dan mengikuti Yesus. Mereka tidak menikmati kesuksesan mereka dan menghibur diri karena sudah mendapatkan ikan yang banyak sekali. Tetapi mereka meninggalkannya. Inilah bukti bahwa mereka tidak berorientasi pada mukjizat yang terjadi tetapi mereka dimampukan Allah melihat siapa itu Yesus Kristus. Mereka sadar bahwa panggilan mengikut Yesus itu yang lebih utama dari sekedar menikmati kesuksesan dan mukjizat.

Sudahkah kita mengikutiNya dengan sepenuh hati kita?

Berbahagia di dalam Tuhan
Mazmur 33:1-22


Apa yang menjadi kebahagiaan anda? Mungkin ada orang yang secara spontan mengatakan: saya bahagia kalau punya banyak uang, bisa makan yang enak, atau punya pasangan yang keren. Atau mungkin ada yang berpendapat bahwa kebahagiaan dicapai dengan kedudukan dan pendidikan yang tinggi, kesehatan yang prima, dan penampilan yang OK. Setidak-tidaknya itulah gambaran yang umum dipropagandakan melalui iklan dan film-film di televisi. Benarkah kebahagiaan kita dapat dicapai dengan hal-hal tersebut di atas?
Mazmur ini berbicara mengenai hubungan antara apa yang dilakukan Tuhan dengan ajakan untuk bersyukur, bernyanyi dan bersorak-sorai. Mazmur 33 ini berbeda dengan mazmur lain yang ada di bagian 1 kelompok mazmur yaitu Kelompok Mazmur 1-41. Mazmur dalam kelompok ini lebih banyak bicara tentang ratapan dan bukan ajakan untuk bersyukur atau bersorak-sorai. Keunikan lain dari mazmur ini adalah mazmur ini menghubungkan kebahagiaan dan sukacita manusia dengan sifat-sifat Tuhan, pekerjaan Tuhan dan diri Tuhan, yang mengasihi dan memperhatikan orang benar atau orang yang percaya kepada-Nya. Dengan kata lain bagaimana hubungan antara doktrin Allah dengan kebahagiaan jiwa manusia. Pengetahuan akan sifat-sifat Allah itu mempengaruhi perkembangan jiwa manusia. Tentu saja fokus utama dari Mazmur ini bukan pada kebahagiaan dan kepuasaan manusia tetapi berfokus pada natur Allah dan perbuatan Allah yang mampu membuat manusia memiliki sukacita yang penuh dalam hidupnya.
Mari kita mulai membuka bagian-bagian dari mazmur ini untuk melihat hubungan antara natur Allah dengan jiwa manusia. Ayat 1-11 berbicara tentang ajakan kepada orang-orang benar untuk bersorak-sorai dalam Tuhan, kemudian pemazmur memberikan alasan untuk bersorak-sorai atau bersyukur atau bernyanyi tersebut. Alasan pertama atas dasar apa yang Allah kerjakan dan kedaulatan serta kemahakuasaan Allah atas alam dan sejarah manusia. Allah menjadikan alam namun Dia juga yang menentukan arah kehidupan manusia. Rencana Tuhan tetap selama-lamanya, rancangan hati-Nya turun temurun. Allah adalah Allah yang adil, setia dan berdaulat atau semua ciptaan-Nya, karena ini semua pemazmur mengajak orang-orang benar untuk bersorak-sorai atau bersyukur dan bernyanyi. Itu sifat-sifat Allah yang patut dijadikan dasar untuk ucapan syukur dan pujian serta nyanyian. Pada ayat 8 pemazmur memberikan sebuah pernyataan dalam nada yang berwibawa dengan menyatakan mengenai kuasa Allah yang mampu membuat segenap bumi takut pada Tuhan dan penduduk dunia gentar terhadap Dia. Lalu pemazmur melanjutkan dengan nada yang lebih berotoritas dengan menyatakan Tuhan menggagalkan rencana bangsa-bangsa dan suku-suku bangsa dan hanya rancangan-Nya saja yang kekal dan tetap ada selama-lamanya. Inilah alasan mengapa manusia patut gentar di hadapan Allah. Karena Dia bukan Allah yang didapat dikendalikan oleh manusia tetapi Dia Allah yang menetapkan rencana-Nya dalam sejarah hidup manusia.


33:1.Bersorak-sorailah, hai orang-orang benar, dalam TUHAN! Sebab memuji-muji itu layak bagi orang-orang jujur.
33:2Bersyukurlah kepada TUHAN dengan kecapi, bermazmurlah bagi-Nya dengan gambus sepuluh tali!
33:3Nyanyikanlah bagi-Nya nyanyian baru; petiklah kecapi baik-baik dengan sorak-sorai!
33:4Sebab firman TUHAN itu benar, segala sesuatu dikerjakan-Nya dengan kesetiaan.
33:5Ia senang kepada keadilan dan hukum; bumi penuh dengan kasih setia TUHAN.
33:6Oleh firman TUHAN langit telah dijadikan, oleh nafas dari mulut-Nya segala tentaranya.
33:7Ia mengumpulkan air laut seperti dalam bendungan, Ia menaruh samudera raya ke dalam wadah.
33:8Biarlah segenap bumi takut kepada TUHAN, biarlah semua penduduk dunia gentar terhadap Dia!
33:9Sebab Dia berfirman, maka semuanya jadi; Dia memberi perintah, maka semuanya ada.
33:10TUHAN menggagalkan rencana bangsa-bangsa; Ia meniadakan rancangan suku-suku bangsa;
33:11tetapi rencana TUHAN tetap selama-lamanya, rancangan hati-Nya turun-temurun.

Bagian kedua dari mazmur ini merupakan penegasan dari bagian pertama, hal ini ditunjukkan melalui pengulangan yang dengan maksud menekankan gagasan pertama dengan lebih mendalam. Pendekatan pada bagian kedua lebih khusus dan personal, pemazmur bicara tentang bangsa yang menjadi pilihan Allah. Bangsa ini menjadi milik-Nya sendiri yang disebutkan dalam bagian pertama yaitu orang-orang benar dan jujur. Bagian pertama menunjukkan karakteristik dari bangsa pilihan Allah, tetapi bagian dua pemazmur menekankan bagian kepemilikan Allah terhadap bangsa ini. Oleh karena kepemilikan ini, maka Tuhan secara logis memiliki perhatian penuh terhadap bangsa milik-Nya. Tuhan membentuk hati mereka dan memperhatikan segala pekerjaan mereka. Kepemilikan ini dikaitkan dengan kepemilikan seorang raja terhadap rakyatnya. Rakyat berlindung dan bersandar pada kekuatan rajanya, tetapi pemazmur menyadarkan pembacanya dengan menyatakan bahwa kekuatan dan kekuasaan seorang raja atau pahlawan tidak bisa menjamin keselamatan dirinya sendiri. Selain itu kuda juga sebuah simbol kemenangan dan ketangkasan, tetapi hal ini pun tidak menjamin kemenangan dan lepas dari bahaya atau kekalahan. Dengan menyatakan demikian pemazmur mengajak pembacanya untuk melihat bahwa kekuatan dan sarana manusia tidak dapat dijadikan sebagai jaminan untuk keselamatan dan terhindar dari bahaya atau malapetaka.

33:12.Berbahagialah bangsa, yang Allahnya ialah TUHAN, suku bangsa yang dipilih-Nya menjadi milik-Nya sendiri!
33:13TUHAN memandang dari sorga, Ia melihat semua anak manusia;33:14dari tempat kediaman-Nya Ia menilik semua penduduk bumi.
33:15Dia yang membentuk hati mereka sekalian, yang memperhatikan segala pekerjaan mereka.
33:16Seorang raja tidak akan selamat oleh besarnya kuasa; seorang pahlawan tidak akan tertolong oleh besarnya kekuatan.
33:17Kuda adalah harapan sia-sia untuk mencapai kemenangan, yang sekalipun besar ketangkasannya tidak dapat memberi keluputan.
33:18Sesungguhnya, mata TUHAN tertuju kepada mereka yang takut akan Dia, kepada mereka yang berharap akan kasih setia-Nya,33:19untuk melepaskan jiwa mereka dari pada maut dan memelihara hidup mereka pada masa kelaparan.

Bagian ketiga, yaitu ayat 20-22 merupakan sebuah penekanan dan kesimpulan terakhir untuk menanamkan gagasan hubungan antara natur Allah dan jiwa manusia yang dimampukan untuk bersukacita karena iman pada natur dan perbuatan Allah. Bagian ini ditutup oleh sebuah pernyataan iman dan doa pengharapan penyertaan kasih setia Tuhan. Pemazmur dalam bagian ini melibatkan dirinya dengan pembaca, bahwa hatinya pun bersukacita karena Tuhan. Pemazmur juga menyatakan bahwa Tuhan adalah penolong dan perisainya. Pemazmur merupakan bagian dari komunitas besar orang-orang beriman dan meneguhkan bahwa pengalaman bangsa pilihan itu merupakan pengalaman dirinya dan pengakuannya juga. Bukan hanya dalam pengakuan dan pengalaman dari satu orang tetapi umat Allah secara historis. Pemazmur mengajak pembaca untuk berharap kepada Tuhan sama seperti pemazmur dan umat Tuhan.

33:20Jiwa kita menanti-nantikan TUHAN. Dialah penolong kita dan perisai kita!
33:21Ya, karena Dia hati kita bersukacita, sebab kepada nama-Nya yang kudus kita percaya.
33:22Kasih setia-Mu, ya TUHAN, kiranya menyertai kami, seperti kami berharap kepada-Mu.

Bahagia di dalam Tuhan adalah dengan mempercayakan diri kita kepada-Nya untuk menikmati diri-Nya dan mengijinkan Dia berkarya di dalam hidup kita.

Tuhan Yesus Yang Kudus
Lukas 23:1-49

Kisah peradilan, penderitaan dan kematian Kristus yang kita dengar dan baca hari ini menyatakan ketidakbersalahan dan ketidakberdosaanNya. Dalam bacaan ini, kita menemukan paling tidak lima kali disebutkan bahwa Kristus tidak bersalah/tidak berdosa baik secara moral ataupun Dia menentang pemerintahan secara politik. Tuhan Yesus dituduhkan sebagai penyesat, melarang orang membayar pajak dan menyebut dirinya raja, istilah raja dipakai untuk membuat tuduhan palsu bahwa Yesus penentang dan ancaman bagi Kaisar. Pilatus mengintrogasi Tuhan Yesus dengan pemeriksaan yang langsung, tetapi ini bukan pemeriksaan yang adil karena tidak ada saksi mata yang dihadirkan dalam pengadilan tersebut. Namun, meskipun demikian Pilatus menyatakan sampai tiga kali bahwa Yesus tidak bersalah atas tuduhan-tuduhan yang dituduhkan kepadaNya. Dengan kata lain bahwa itu semua adalah tuduhan palsu. 

Jika Pilatus saja harus menyatakan Yesus tidak bersalah sampai tiga kali berturut-turut,maka kita perlu memperhatikannya. Pilatus bertanya kepada Yesus :”Engkaukah raja orang Yahudi?” Yesus menjawabnya :”Engkau sendiri yang mengatakannya”. Jawaban ini dengan kata lain ingin mengatakan “aku bukan apa yang mereka tuduhkan”. Ini artinya juga bahwa “aku juga tidak berpihak kepada orang Yahudi” Jawaban ini cukup meyakinkan Pilatus untuk membuat sebuah pernyataan bahwa Yesus tidak bersalah. Pengadilan ini tentunya bukan peradilan yang adil karena tidak ada saksi dihadirkan membela sang tertuduh. Di dalam Injil Yohanes menyatakan jawaban Yesus bahwa kerajaan-Nya bukanlah dari dunia ini. Ini sebuah pernyataan tegas bahwa ini tidak ada ancaman terhadap pemerintahan romawi. Selain Pilatus, Herodes pun tidak menemukan kesalahan apa-apa dari Tuhan Yesus. Karena peradilan Tuhan Yesus ini maka Herodes dan Pilatus berteman. 

Meskipun demikian, pihak oposisi terus mendesak Pilatus menyalibkan Tuhan Yesus. Mereka ini, termasuk di dalam imam kepala dan ahli-ahli taurat yang sangat membenci Tuhan Yesus, mengapa? Jawaban singkatnya adalah karena Tuhan Yesus  banyak orang percaya kepada-Nya dan jika semua orang mengikutiNya  maka kemungkinan besar ada pemberontakan terhadap roma semakin besar. JIka pemberontakan terjadi maka imam kepala dan ahli Taurat akan kehilangan posisinya. Apabila hal itu terjadi maka, kemungkinan bangsa Roma mengambil dan menghancurkan Bait Suci mereka semakin besar (Yoh. 11:45-48). Ancaman terhadap posisi dan semua akses terhadap kehidupan yang nyaman dan terhormat jelas sudah didepan mata bila Yesus dibiarkan mendapatkan banyak pengikut. Menariknya Pilatus lebih takut dengan suara dari kelompok para imam kepala dan ahli Taurat. Mereka meminta Pilatus membebaskan Barabas, seorang pemberontak dan pembunuh, supaya Tuhan Yesus tetapi disalibkan, apapun alasannya. Mereka berteriak dengan nyaring :”Salibkan Dia. Salibkan Dia.” Pilatus mengabulkannya dan Tuhan Yesus dibawa untuk disalibkan. Herodes pun mengambil bagian dalam kejahatan yang dilakukan Pilatus, imam kepala dan para ahli Taurat, dengan cara dia mengejek dan mengolok-olok Tuhan Yesus serta bermufakat dengan mereka untuk membunuhNya. 

Saudara perhatikanlah ini bagaimana sikap orang-orang berdosa itu Tuhan Yesus. Mulai dari para pemimpin agama Yahudi yang menuduhkan tuduhan palsu, Pilatus yang lebih takut pada suara banyak orang dan Herodes yang mengolok-olok dan bermufakat untuk membunuh Tuhan Yesus, Barabas, seorang pembunuh, sampai ke penjahat yang ingin dibebaskan dari salib, yang ada disamping Tuhan Yesus. Mereka menampilkan sikap-sikap yang menolak Kristus dan tidak merasa bahwa diri mereka bersalah, tetapi mereka semua adalah orang-orang yang berdosa. Lihatlah perkataan dan perbuatan mereka. Mereka merasa ingin menegakkan kedamaian di tengah-tengah masyarakat dengan mereka membunuh orang tidak bersalah. 

Namun, sikap Tuhan Yesus menunjukkan sikap yang sebaliknya. Lihatlah bagaimana Tuhan Yesus berkata-kata dan bertindak. Pada saat diadili Dia menyatakan apa yang sebenar-benarnya sehingga Pilatus pun tahu Dia tidak bersalah. Tidak ada cela dalam diri Tuhan kita Yesus Kristus. Dia tidak bersalah dan tidak berdosa. Saat diadili, disiksa dan disalib, perkataan-Nya dan tindakan-Nya menunjukkan kepada kita bahwa Dia adalah orang benar dan kudus. 

Ketika Dia berjalan menuju bukit Golgota, Dia menyampaikan perhatianNya kepada perempuan-perempuan yang menangis dan mengikuti Dia. Dia berkata :”…janganlah kamu menangisi Aku, melainkan tangisilah dirimu sendiri dan anak-anakmu!” Ditengah penderitaan yang hebat memikul Salib-Nya, Dia masih memperhatikan kepentingan orang-orang yang mengikuti-Nya. 

Ketika para prajurit mengundi dan membagi-bagi jubah dan pakaianNya. Dia berkata :”Ampunilah mereka karena mereka tidak tahu apa yang mereka perbuat?” Perkataan ini keluar dari seorang yang sedang berada dalam penderitaan yang luar biasa, tetapi didalam kondisi sehebat itu pun Dia tetap mengasihi orang-orang yang menyalibkanNya. 

Perhatikan juga perkataan dan sikap Tuhan Yesus terhadap pejahat yang meminta mengingatnya jika Dia datang sebagai raja lalu Tuhan Yesus berkata : “Pada saat ini juga engkau bersama-sama dengan Aku di dalam Firdaus”.

Pada saat terakhir hidup-Nya dalam kesengsaraan dan penderitaan yang begitu hebat sekalipun, Tuhan Yesus tetap menunjukkan hormat kepada Allah Bapa. Dia menyerahkan nyawa-Nya dengan berkata :”Ya Bapa, ke dalam tangan-Mu Kuserahkan nyawa-Ku”. Jika dia adalah seorang manusia biasa adalah wajar jika dia mengumpat, atau kecewa dengan Allah. Wajar juga jika dia pun menyadari bahwa saya layak mati dan ada tuduhan hati nurani terhadap semua hal yang telah dia perbuat selama hidupnya sebagai orang berdosa. NAMUN, Kristus adalah Allah yang menjadi manusia. Dia tidak kehilangan jati diri-Nya ditengah penderitaan yang sangat hebat sekalipun. Dia tetap sadar bahwa ketaatan-Nya adalah kepada Allah Bapa. Dia pun sadar bahwa Dia memiliki kuasa atas nyawa-Nya sendiri. Dia juga sadar bahwa Dia mengorbankan diri-Nya dengan sukarela dan Dia menyelesaikan apa yang harus dikerjakan. 

Tiga perkataan Tuhan Yesus tersebut menunjukkan bahwa Dialah Allah yang secara konsisten dan sadar mengasihi orang-orang berdosa. Kekudusan-Nya selaras dengan perkataan dan perbuatan-Nya. Penderitaan tidak bisa menghancurkan diri-Nya sebagai Tuhan yang sejati yang mengasihi dan menyelamatkan orang-orang berdosa. Penderitaan tidak membelokkan diri-Nya atau menjatuhkan diri-Nya dalam dosa seperti apa yang dilakukan Pilatus, Herodes, dan para tokoh agama serta orang-orang sekitarnya. Dia tanpa cela dan noda dalam seluruh keberadaan-Nya dan kasih-Nya konsisten sampai akhir. 

Dialah yang dinubuatkan oleh Mazmur yang kita baca hari ini. Anak Domba Allah yang tidak bercacat dan tidak bercela layak mengadakan penebusan dosa-dosa kita. Pengorbanan-Nya dalam kesadaran dan kerelaan bahwa Dia dan tanpa Dia tidak ada satu pun dari antara kita dapat menyelamatkan dirinya dari dosa. Hal ini kita bisa lihat dalam ayat 44-46 :” 23:44 Ketika itu hari sudah kira-kira jam dua belas, lalu kegelapan meliputi seluruh daerah itu sampai jam tiga, 45 sebab matahari tidak bersinar. Dan tabir Bait Suci   terbelah dua. 46 Lalu Yesus berseru dengan suara nyaring: “Ya Bapa, ke dalam tangan-Mu Kuserahkan nyawa-Ku.” Dan sesudah berkata demikian Ia menyerahkan nyawa-Nya. 47 Ketika kepala pasukan melihat apa yang terjadi, ia memuliakan Allah, katanya: “Sungguh, orang ini adalah orang benar!” 48 Dan sesudah seluruh orang banyak, yang datang berkerumun di situ untuk tontonan itu, melihat apa yang terjadi itu, pulanglah mereka sambil memukul-mukul diri. 49 Semua orang yang mengenal Yesus dari dekat, termasuk perempuan-perempuan yang mengikuti Dia dari Galilea, berdiri jauh-jauh dan melihat semuanya itu.”Korban hidup Kristus yang tidak bercacat dan tidak bercela itu layak dan dikenan oleh Allah. Kristus menjadi imam besar yang layak masuk ke tahta Allah mengadakan pengampunan dosa sekali untuk selamanya bagi kita yang percaya kepada-Nya. Inilah yang telah dikerjakan Kristus bagi pengampunan dosa kita diatas kayu salib melalui kasih-Nya yang tidak dapat dihentikan. Jadi seluruh kehidupan, penderitaan dan kematian Kristus bukan hanya sebuah peringatan akan betapa jahatnya dosa dan dampaknya, tetapi juga sebuah peringatan akan ketidakberdosaan dan kasih Kristus yang lebih kuat dari maut bagi kita semua. 

Jika Kristus berdosa maka saya tidak akan mengikuti-Nya, Jika Kristus berdosa maka saya tidak akan bisa diselamatkan, Jika Kristus berdosa maka tidak ada harapan manusia bisa hidup dalam pendamaian dengan Allah, jika Kristus berdosa maka tidak ada harapan hidup kekal. 

TETAPI Kristus tidak berdosa dan tidak bercacat dan bercela maka Dia layak diikuti, Karena Kristus tidak berdosa maka saya mendapatkan keselamatan karena kematian-Nya, karena kristus tidak berdosa maka saya bisa hidup damai dengan Allah, Karena Kristus tidak berdosa maka hidup kekal adalah PASTI.

Respon terhadap ketidakberdosaan Kristus dan korban yang tidak bercacat dan tidak bercela itu adalah pertobatan dengan berpaling kepada Kristus. Sama seperti para perempuan yang mengikuti Tuhan Yesus yang meratap itu, khususnya seperti Penjahat di samping Tuhan, yang menyadari keberdosaan dirinya di hadapan Allah dan berseru kepada Kristus sang Raja atau Sang Anak Domba Paskah yang tidak bercela dan bernoda itu untuk menyelamatkannya. Juga seperti seorang kepala pasukan yang mengatakan dan mengakui “Sungguh orang ini adalah orang benar” Pengakuan tersebut menyiratkan bahwa Kristus memang benar dalam sebuah perkataan dan tindakan-Nya dan tidak bercela di hadapan Allah. Ini pun juga diindikasikan oleh apa yang terjadi dengan matahari yang tidak bersinar, alam berkabung akan kegelapan dan kejahatan dosa manusia. Ini seperti tombol reset yang mengingatkan kita kan kejadian pasal 1 ayat 1, sebelum Allah menciptakan langit dan bumi, seluruh bumi dipenuhi kegelapan. Ini seolah memberikan kita sebuah isyarat bahwa kematian Kristus adalah awal penciptaan yang baru, sebuah babak baru bagi kehidupan manusia yang percaya kepada Kristus. Sama seperti juga Simon dari Kirene yang pada akhirnya (Markus 15:21) percaya kepada Kristus, dia dan seluruh keluarganya (Kis. 13:1 bandingkan dengan Rom. 16:13).

Jadi Ingatlah akan kebenaran ini bahwa Kristus yang tidak bercacat dan tidak bercela, kudus dan tidak berdosa adalah sungguh benar, oleh karena itu Dia layak memberikan pengampunan dosa kepada manusia yang berdosa.

Identitas Kristen
Matius 5:13-20

5:13 “Kamu adalah garam dunia .
Jika garam itu menjadi tawar, dengan apakah ia diasinkan? Tidak ada lagi gunanya selain dibuang dan diinjak orang.
5:14 Kamu adalah terang dunia.
Kota yang terletak di atas gunung tidak mungkin tersembunyi.
5:15 Lagipula orang tidak menyalakan pelita lalu meletakkannya di bawah gantang, melainkan di atas kaki dian sehingga menerangi semua orang di dalam rumah itu.
5:16 Demikianlah hendaknya terangmu bercahaya di depan orang,
supaya mereka melihat perbuatanmu yang baik dan memuliakan Bapamu yang di sorga.”

5:17 “Janganlah kamu menyangka, bahwa Aku datang untuk meniadakan hukum Taurat atau kitab para nabi. Aku datang bukan untuk meniadakannya, melainkan untuk menggenapinya .
5:18 Karena Aku berkata kepadamu: Sesungguhnya selama belum lenyap langit dan bumi ini, satu iota atau satu titikpun tidak akan ditiadakan dari hukum Taurat, sebelum semuanya terjadi.
5:19 Karena itu siapa yang meniadakan salah satu perintah hukum Taurat sekalipun yang paling kecil, dan mengajarkannya demikian kepada orang lain, ia akan menduduki tempat yang paling rendah di dalam Kerajaan Sorga; tetapi siapa yang melakukan dan mengajarkan segala perintah-perintah hukum Taurat, ia akan menduduki tempat yang tinggi di dalam Kerajaan Sorga.
5:20 Maka Aku berkata kepadamu: Jika hidup keagamaanmu tidak lebih benar dari pada hidup keagamaan ahli-ahli Taurat dan orang-orang Farisi, sesungguhnya kamu tidak akan masuk ke dalam Kerajaan Sorga.

Kita sudah terlalu sering mendengar ayat ini dikhotbahkan, bahkan seringkali slogan” kita harus menjadi garam dan terang dunia”. Namun pertanyaannya adalah apakah benar slogan tersebut? Apakah kita yang sudah percaya kepada Kristus harus menjadi garam dan terang dunia lagi? Apakah menjadi garam itu sebuah proses ataukah itu sebuah identitas baru yang diberikan Allah melalui iman di dalam Yesus Kristus ketika kita memutuskan untuk percaya Yesus sebagai Tuhan dan juruselamat kita?
Konteks bagian ini adalah ketika Yesus berkhotbah diatas bukit kepada para murid-murid-Nya. Gagasan besar dari dalam khotbah ini adalah bahwa Yesus mengajarkan kepada para murid-murid-Nya bahwa mereka orang-orang yang berada dalam nilai-nilai kerajaan Allah yang berbeda dengan dunia. Kerajaan yang dimaksudkan oleh Yesus adalah kerajaan yang sungsang (terbalik). Yang miskin adalah orang yang akan empunya kerajaan Allah, sedangkan jika dibalik sepertinya hanya orang kaya yang memiliki kenyamanan dunia. Juga berbahagialah mereka yang dianiaya karena kebenaran karena mereka yang empunya kerajaan Sorga. Mereka yang teraniaya karena kebenaran itu karena dunia membenci Kristus, sang kebenaran itu sendiri.

Kalimat “Kamu adalah garam dunia” dan “kamu adalah terang dunia” adalah kalimat definitif. Apa itu kalimat definitif? Itu adalah kalimat yang tidak bisa diperdebatkan. Contoh dari kalimat ini misalnya : Jakarta adalah Ibu kota Indonesia. Mereka adalah garam dan terang dunia. Jika garam maka natur dari garam adalah asin, maka keasinan itu adalah identitasnya. Jika terang maka natur dari terang adalah cahaya, maka cahaya yang menerangi adalah identitasnya sesuai naturnya. Jika garam jadi tawar dia bukan garam lagi. Jika pelita kehilangan terang atau cahayanya maka ia bukan terang lagi, ia adalah gelap. Hal ini juga berarti kita bukan lagi yang lama, kita berbeda di tengah dunia ini.
Ungkapan “kita harus menjadi garam dan terang dunia”. Ungkapan seperti ini ternyata tidak sepenuhnya tepat. Tuhan Yesus mengajarkan bahwa kita adalah garam dan terang. Ini tentang identitas kita di tengah-tengah dunia, bukan sekadar peranan. Peranan justru muncul dari identitas. Persoalan di dunia bukan terjadi karena tidak ada garam atau terang, tetapi karena garam itu telah menjadi tawar dan terang itu telah ditutupi oleh gantang. Istilah “menjadi tawar” (mōranthē) secara hurufiah berarti “menjadi bodoh,” karena kata dasar mōrainō memang mengandung arti “menjadi atau menunjukkan diri bodoh” (1 Kor 1:20; Rm 1:22). Adalah sebuah kebodohan apabila sebuah benda disebut garam tetapi benda itu tidak memiliki rasa asin di dalamnya.

Selain garam kita juga adalah terang dunia. Sebagai terang dunia, kita terpanggil untuk memainkan peranan di tengah kegelapan dunia. Meminjam ungkapan Paulus, identitas sebagai terang dimaksudkan: “supaya kamu tiada beraib dan tiada bernoda, sebagai anak-anak Allah yang tidak bercela di tengah-tengah angkatan yang bengkok hatinya dan yang sesat ini, sehingga kamu bercahaya di antara mereka seperti bintang-bintang di dunia” (Flp 2:15). Kegelapan dunia bukan untuk diratapi dan didoakan saja. Kita terpanggil untuk mengalahkan kegelapan melalui kesalehan.

Sebagian penafsir Alkitab mengaitkan “terang dunia” ini dengan ajaran masyarakat Qumran pada zaman Tuhan Yesus. Mereka juga menyebut diri sebagai anak-anak terang. Perbedaannya, mereka tinggal menyendiri dan terpisah dari dunia. Kesalehan mereka hanya terlihat di gua-gua Qumran. Tidak demikian dengan para pengikut Tuhan Yesus. Mereka dituntut untuk tetap hidup di dalam dunia yang gelap. Justru di tengah kegelapan inilah keberadaan mereka menjadi lebih disorot dan bermanfaat. Kita adalah terang dunia.

Garam dan Terang yang dimaksud pada ayat 16, dihubungkan dengan perbuatan kita yang baik dan memuliakan Bapamu yang di Sorga. Itu adalah tujuan akhir dari semua pekerjaan atau perbuatan yang baik kita kerjakan selama kita hidup sebagai murid Kristus di dunia ini. Dunia harus melihat dengan jelas dan nyata di depan mata mereka perbuatan baik dari setiap murid Kristus. Tidak samar-samar tetapi benar-benar nyata. Bukan sekedar sebuah slogan “kita harus menjadi terang” tetapi benar-benar melakukan tindakan yang sesuai dengan identitas kita di dalam Kristus, yaitu sebagai garam, yang menggarami dunia dan terang, yang menerangi dunia. Selain itu puncak dari setiap perbuatan baik kita adalah untuk memperlihatkan mereka kemuliaan Allah Bapa. Sama seperti ketika Yesus berkata dalam Yohanes 5:19 :”Aku berkata kepadamu, sesungguhnya Anak tidak dapat mengerjakan sesuatu dari diri-Nya sendiri, jikalau tidak Ia melihat Bapa mengerjakannya; sebab apa yang dikerjakan Bapa, itu juga yang dikerjakan Anak.”.
Jadi apa yang dilakukan oleh Yesus itu juga dilakukan oleh Bapa. Yesus melakukan apa yang dilakukan Bapa. Sang Anak merefleksikan perbuatan Sang Bapa, supaya setiap orang yang melihat perbuatan Sang Anak mereka melihat Sang Bapa. Ini gagasan yang dekat juga dalam kehidupan kita bukan? Kata-kata seorang anak juga merupakan kata-kata yang sering ia dengar dari orangtuanya. Anak adalah cerminan orang tua. Kita dapat melihat kedua orang tuanya melihat anaknya.

Bagian kedua dari bagian kita hari ini juga berbicara mengenai Tuhan Yesus akan menggenapi seluruh Firman Tuhan. Ini adalah sebuah pernyataan yang sangat berani. Tidak ada orang Yahudi atau Rabi yang sanggup menyatakan diri telah menggenapi seluruh hukum-hukum Tuhan, dalam arti memenuhi seluruh standarnya. Tuhan Yesus seperti Sang Garam dan Terang itu. Tuhan Yesus menyatakan kepada murid-muridNya bahwa jika hidup keagamaan kita tidak lebih baik dari orang-orang farisi dan ahli-ahli Taurat maka tidak ada yang bisa masuk ke dalam Kerajaan Sorga. Padahal, kehidupan keagamaan orang Farisi dan ahli Taurat pun menjadi sorotan dan seringkali Tuhan Yesus membongkar kemunafikan mereka. Dengan demikian Tuhan Yesus menyatakan dengan berani bahwa hanya Ia yang sanggup menggenapi seluruh hukum Allah.
Nah, pertanyaannya adalah apa hubungannya dengan bagian garam dan terang?

Hubungannya adalah dalam hal motif. Apakah motif dalam berbuat baik? Ketika kita percaya dan hidup di dalam Kristus maka Kristus yang menggenapi seluruh hukum Allah dalam hidup kita. Karena kebenaran inilah kita dibenarkan oleh Allah bukan karena kebaikan kita tetapi oleh perbuatan dan Kristus sendiri. Sehingga dengan demikian setiap kali kita berbuat baik dan menunjukkan perbuatan baik tersebut kepada dunia, itu didasarkan pada motif bahwa hanya melalui Kristus kita dibenarkan oleh Allah. Kesombongan karena berbuat baik bukan karena kita baik tetapi karena Kristus telah berbuat baik lebih dahulu kepada kita dengan menggenapi seluruh hukum Allah dalam diri-Nya sendiri, supaya kita yang percaya kepada-Nya dibenarkan oleh perbuatan-Nya. Jadi ingatlah bahwa ketika kita berbuat baik, kita ini sedang bersyukur pada Allah karena apa yang telah Kristus kerjakan bagi kita. Dia menggenapi sluruh hukum Allah. Setiap perbuatan baik kita adalah refleksi dari apa yang telah Kristus lakukan bagi kita. Jika kita bisa berbuat baik itu semua karena Kristus yang adalah di dalam kita.

Identitas Kristen pun dibangun atas dasar kebenaran Kristus. Tuhan Yesus memenuhi seluruh hukum Allah supaya ketika kita menaruh iman di dalam Yesus Kristus, kita pun dihisabkan di dalam kebenaran-Nya yaitu kebenaran Allah. Anak di dalam kita dan kita didalam Anak. Anak di dalam Bapa dan Bapa di dalam Anak. Terang itu ada di dalam kita dan natur kita diubahkan menjadi yang baru karena Kristus. Kita adalah surat Kristus yang dapat dibaca oleh semua orang. Roh Allah menuliskan hukum-hukum-Nya dalam hati kita. Bukan dengan kekuatan manusia tetapi dengan kekuatan Roh, Paulus dan para rasul yang lain menjadi pelayan-pelayan Kristus. Mereka disanggupkan Allah untuk melakukan pekerjaan Allah bukan karena kesanggupan mereka sendiri. Sama halnya dengan kita, saksikankan Kristus dan beritakanlah kepada setiap orang apa yang sudah Tuhan Yesus sudah perbuat di dalam kematian dan kebangkitanNya, dia telah menggenapi seluruh hukum Taurat supaya kita dibenarkan Allah dan hidup di dalam kebenaran oleh Roh Kristus.

Benih Kerajaan
Markus 4: 26-34

26 Lalu kata Yesus: “Beginilah hal Kerajaan Allah itu: seumpama orang yang menaburkan benih di tanah, 27 lalu pada malam hari ia tidur dan pada siang hari ia bangun, dan benih itu mengeluarkan tunas dan tunas itu makin tinggi, bagaimana terjadinya tidak diketahui orang itu. 28 Bumi dengan sendirinya mengeluarkan buah, mula-mula tangkainya, lalu bulirnya, kemudian butir-butir yang penuh isinya dalam bulir itu. 29 Apabila buah itu sudah cukup masak, orang itu segera menyabit, sebab musim menuai sudah tiba.”
30 Kata-Nya lagi: “Dengan apa hendak kita membandingkan Kerajaan Allah itu, atau dengan perumpamaan manakah hendaknya kita menggambarkannya? 31 Hal Kerajaan itu seumpama biji sesawi yang ditaburkan di tanah. Memang biji itu yang paling kecil dari pada segala jenis benih yang ada di bumi.32 Tetapi apabila ia ditaburkan, ia tumbuh dan menjadi lebih besar dari pada segala sayuran yang lain dan mengeluarkan cabang-cabang yang besar, sehingga burung-burung di udara dapat bersarang dalam naungannya.” 33 Dalam banyak perumpamaan yang semacam itu Ia memberitakan firman kepada mereka sesuai dengan pengertian mereka, 34 dan tanpa perumpamaan Ia tidak berkata-kata kepada mereka, tetapi kepada murid-murid-Nya Ia menguraikan segala sesuatu secara tersendiri.


Jika Saudara suka menanam buah labu, Saudara mungkin pernah mendengar tentang benih biji labu premium varietas raksasa yang disebut Dill’s Atlantic Giant. Dikembangkan di tengah suatu perkebunan keluarga di wilayah Atlantik Kanada, buah-buah labu yang tumbuh dari benih ini terus mencatat rekor di berbagai belahan dunia. Pada tahun 2011, sebuah labu yang ditanam di Quebec berhasil mencetak rekor dunia baru karena beratnya 825 kg. Dari labu sebesar itu dapat dibuat hampir 1000 potong kue labu!


Ketika para wartawan berita menanyakan bagaimana labu tersebut dapat tumbuh menjadi sebesar itu, sang petani menjawab bahwa itu terjadi karena kualitas tanahnya. Benihnya memang berasal dari varietas yang menghasilkan buah berukuran besar, tetapi tanahnya juga harus tepat, karena jika tidak, labu tidak akan dapat tumbuh dengan baik.
Sama seperti yang teks yang kita baca, perumpamaan ini merupakan sambungan dari perumpamaan seorang penabur yang menekankan pada jenis-jenis tanah yang bisa menumbuhkan benih dan tidak dapat menumbuhkan benih. Tetapi perumpamaan ini menekankan pada potensi benih kecil jika benih tersebut bertumbuh.


Benih adalah awal dari kehidupan sebuah pohon/tanaman. Sebuah pohon dimulai dari benih, benih yang ada ditanah atau jatuh di tanah. Benih biasanya sesuatu yang kecil tetapi benih memiliki potensi yang besar. Benih yang bertumbuh akan bertunas kemudian bertumbuh besar. Memiliki akar yang kuat ke bawah tanah dan cabang-cabang menyebar ke kiri dan kanan serta ke atas.


Tema dari perumpamaan ini adalah tema mengenai Kerajaan Allah. Jadi perumpamaan ini menggambarkan Kerajaan Allah. Untuk bisa melihat gambaran dari perumpamaan ini kita perlu melihat gambaran yang mirip perumpamaan ini mengenai gambaran kerajaan, yaitu di Daniel 4, Yehezkiel 31 dan Yehezkiel 17.
Daniel 4:10-12 4:10 “Adapun penglihatan yang kudapat di tempat tidurku itu, demikian: di tengah-tengah bumi ada sebatang pohon yang sangat tinggi; 11 pohon itu bertambah besar dan kuat, tingginya sampai ke langit, dan dapat dilihat sampai ke ujung seluruh bumi. 12 Daun-daunnya indah, buahnya berlimpah-limpah, padanya ada makanan bagi semua yang hidup; di bawahnya binatang-binatang di padang mencari tempat bernaung dan di dahan-dahannya bersarang burung-burung di udara, dan segala makhluk mendapat makanan dari padanya.” Ayat ini berbicara menggambarkan mengenai Kerajaan Babilonia yang menjadi naungan bangsa-bangsa dan memiliki pengaruh yang besar.


Contoh kedua ada di Yehezkiel 31:2-8 “2″Hai anak manusia, katakanlah kepada Firaun, raja Mesir dan kepada khalayak ramai yang mengikutinya: Di dalam kebesaranmu siapakah yang dapat menyamai engkau?
3 Lihat, Aku menyamakan engkau dengan (Asyria) pohon aras di Libanon, penuh dengan cabang yang elok dan daun yang rumpun sekali; tumbuhnya sangat tinggi, puncaknya sampai ke langit.
4 Sungai-sungai membuatnya besar samudera raya membuatnya meninggi; itu membuat sungainya mengalir mengelilingi bedengnya itu; dan menjulurkan saluran-saluran ke segala pohon yang ada di padang.
5 Maka dari itu tumbuhnya lebih tinggi dari segala pohon di padang; ranting-rantingnya menjadi banyak, cabang-cabangnya menjadi panjang lantaran air yang melimpah datang.
6 Pada rantingnya diam bersarang segala burung yang di udara, di bawah cabangnya segala binatang di hutan, melahirkan anaknya; dan semuanya bangsa besar duduk bernaung di bawahnya.
7 Ia elok karena besarnya dan karena cabangnya yang panjang-panjang; karena akarnya julur-jalar sampai di air yang berlimpah-limpah.
8 Pohon-pohon aras di dalam taman Allah tidak akan dapat menyainginya, juga pohon sanobar tidak akan dapat menyamai ranting-rantingnya, dan pohon berangan tidak dapat dibandingkan dengan cabang-cabangnya. Segala pohon-pohon yang di taman Allah tiada yang dapat disamakan dengan dia mengenai keelokannya.


Yehezkiel 31 juga bicara tentang kebesaran Firaun yang disamakan dengan kebesaran Kerajaan Asyria. Ada gambaran yang sama bahwa ada pohon besar yang memberikan naungan kepada burung-burung atas bangsa-bangsa dibawah pemerintahan dan kerajaannya.
Dua contoh ini memang bukan tentang Israel tetapi ini jelas sebuah gambaran mengenai gambaran yang membantu untuk memberikan aspek kerajaan dari perumpamaan yang Tuhan Yesus sampaikan.


Sekarang mari kita melihat Yehezkiel 17 : 22-23 “22Beginilah firman Tuhan ALLAH: Aku sendiri akan mengambil sebuah carang dari puncak pohon aras yang tinggi dan menanamnya; Aku mematahkannya dari pucuk yang paling ujung dan yang masih muda dan Aku sendiri akan menanamnya di atas sebuah gunung yang menjulang tinggi ke atas; 23di atas gunung Israel yang tinggi akan Kutanam dia, agar ia bercabang-cabang dan berbuah dan menjadi pohon aras yang hebat; segala macam burung dan yang berbulu bersayap tinggal di bawahnya, mereka bernaung di bawah cabang-cabangnya.”
Sekarang hubungannya dengan perumpamaan yang Tuhan Yesus sampaikan ini? Hubungannya adalah bahwa benih yang ada di tanah itu adalah benih yang mengalami pertumbuhan karena daya atau kuasa yang tidak bisa dilihat. Kuasa yang dari dalam benih tersebut. Benih ini bicara tentang kuasa Firman Tuhan yang memiliki kuasa dan kekuatan dari dalam diri Allah sendiri untuk bertumbuh. Setelah bertumbuh benih ini menjadi pohon yang besar, memiliki cabang-cabang yang menjulur ke kanan dan kiri, dan menjadi naungan para burung yaitu bangsa-bangsa.
Benih yang kecil itu adalah dimulai dengan Yesus Kristus dari Nazaret, Sang Anak Allah. Yang pernah berada 9 bulan di kandungan Maria. Anak yang dianggap anak dari seorang tukang kayu, Yusuf. Yang melayani hanya di sekitaran Galilea dan Yerusalem. Para murid-Nya adalah para nelayan Galilea yang tidak terkenal. Yang telah mati di atas kayu Salib, menghapuskan dosa kita tetapi kemudian bangkit kembali. Dari situlah benih yang kecil itu menjadi pohon besar sampai menjangkau bangsa-bangsa. Sampai sekarang mereka yang percaya kepada Kristus lebih dari satu bangsa. Bangsa-bangsa tersebut, yaitu mereka yang telah menaruh iman mereka dalam Kristus Yesus, Tuhan kita, berada dalam pemerintahan Raja Yesus.
Implikasi dari kebenaran ini adalah bahwa benih dari Kerajaan Allah atau FIrman Allah itu sendiri yang memiliki kuasa dalam diri-Nya untuk bertumbuh dan berkembang. Kita diperintahkan Raja Yesus untuk menyampaikan Kabar baik-Nya kepada seluruh bangsa sampai Kristus datang kembali. Benih itu mungkin saja tidak bisa kita segera tetapi ketika benih itu bertumbuh maka Kristus akan dimulaikan.

Injil: Oasis Sukacita
Filipi 4:1-19

Sukacita adalah kata yang sulit diucapkan di hari-hari ini. Sejak Covid mulai menyebar di China dan kemudian masuk negara-negara dan akhirnya masuk ke Indonesia. Kita melihat realitas yang tidak kita sukai, banyak orang sakit, bahkan meninggal dunia. Selain penyakit, perang pun membawa kematian dan kesengsaraan, dan karena itulah maka kita sulit menemukan sukacita. Sulit untuk memikirkan sesuatu yang ceria dan senang. Seolah-olah karena kita harus berada dalam bayangan maut. Seperti hidup dibawah intaian musuh yang siap menerkam kita dari segala arah ketika lengah.


Namun, ternyata ada satu hal yang sama yang kita alami dengan apa yang Paulus alami. Paulus mengalami penderitaan bukan karena virus tetapi karena Injil. Dia dipenjarakan karena injil, akan tetapi justru di saat ia ada di penjara, ia menuliskan surat kepada jemaat Filipi (1:12-13). Suratnya itu bukan surat yang bernada sedih atau melankolis, atau berisi keluhan malahan ia menuliskan kata Sukacita (chara/chairō) lebih banyak dibandingkan dengan surat-surat lainnya. Ada 14 kali kata ini dituliskan di dalam Surat Filipi, tersebar di seluruh pasal Surat Filipi. Bahkan dibandingkan dengan penulis Injil dan penulis lain di Perjanjian Baru, Paulus lebih banyak menuliskan kata ini. Ada 50 kata Sukacita; 21 kata dalam bentuk kata benda dan 29 kata dalam bentuk kata kerja). Kata ini memiliki signifikansi yang luar biasa di dalam tulisan Paulus.
Hari ini kita tidak akan membahas seluruh tulisan Paulus mengenai sukacita tetapi kita akan melihat bagian kecil di dalam bagian bacaan kita hari ini. Kita akan melihat darimana sumber sukacita Paulus dan hubungan sukacita tersebut dengan jemaat Filipi.


Sama seperti ketika seseorang menemukan sebuah oasis. Lingkungan disekeliling oasis itu selalu ada tumbuhan hijau dan pohon-pohon yang lebat karena air itu membawa kehidupan kepada tanah sekelilingnya.

Ditengah-tengah tumbuhan dan rerumputan hijau, air oasis itu mengalir dan kemana air itu mengalir membasahi tanah, disitulah kehidupan berkembang dan binatang-binatang pun datang untuk meminumnya. Sebelum kita akan menemukan oasis Paulus di dalam Surat Filipi ini. Kita akan melakukan melihat dahulu kondisi disekitar oasis tersebut. Apa yang ada sekitar oasis tersebut.

Yang menarik adalah ketika Paulus bicara mengenai sukacita kepada orang-orang percaya. Sama seperti dengan jemaat lain, jemaat Filipi pun punya permasalahan. Paling tidak ada 2 permasalahan yang penting yaitu potensi perpecahan dan pengajar (3:2). Ada orang-orang yang masuk ke dalam jemaat Filipi yang mengajarkan bahwa setelah seseorang telah percaya kepada Kristus dia tetap harus memenuhi ketentuan hukum Taurat salah satunya adalah disunat (Legalisme). Mereka berusaha mengikat Filipi dengan Hukum Taurat setelah mereka percaya Kristus. Akan tetapi ada gerakan yang lain, yaitu gerakan libertin yang juga mengajarkan hidup semaumu, sebebas mungkin, tidak perlu mengikuti hukum Taurat (Antinomian/Liberal). Paulus berkata bahwa mereka adalah orang-orang yang mengutamakan perut mereka. Tuhan mereka adalah perut mereka. Kedua ajaran ini jelas salah dan tidak bisa dibiarkan ada di dalam jemaat Filipi, atau kristen pada masa kini. Alkitab mengajarkan bahwa iman kita harus menghasilkan buah pertobatan yang nyata.


Selain ajaran sesat, ada juga potensi perpecahan di dalam jemaat, bahwa ada orang-orang yang hanya memperhatikan kepentingannya sendiri dan tidak sehati sepikir (Euodia dan Sintikhe). Beberapa kali kata sehati dituliskan dalam pasal 2 dilanjutkan dengan sebuah tema kenosis Kristus atau Kristus merendahkan diri menjadi sama dengan manusia. Kedua permasalahan ini jelas telah menyedot sukacita jemaat Filipi. Sukacita yang seharus ada di dalam jemaat kini mulai terganggu karena permasalahan yang ada. Legalisme membuat jemaat filipi harus berusaha sekeras tenaga mereka untuk memenuhi seluruh ketentuan hukum Taurat sebagai ukuran keselamatan mereka. Legalisme seperti lubang tak berdasar dan terus menelan apa yang bisa ditelan dengan cara-cara agamawi. Lakukan doa ini, lakukan puasa ini, lakukan persembahan ini, lakukan pelayanan ini dan itu, atau harus begini dan begitu maka kamu akan diselamatkan. Sukacita kita hilang. Libertin seperti balon yang diisi gas helium terus menerus sehingga dia mengembung dan pada titik tertentu balon tersebut meledak. Silakan hidup sebebas-bebasnya karena kamu telah diselamatkan. Dosa sudah tidak memiliki efek apa-apa terhadap dirimu. Silakan hidup dalam dosa. Sukacita kita hilang karena pada akhir dosa itu akhirnya mengikat kita. Karena sukacita itu bukan sukacita tapi kesenangan.
Ayat 1 memberikan gambaran bagaimana hubungan Paulus dengan jemaat Filipi – Sukacitaku, mahkotaku. Apa yang terjadi dan dilakukan oleh jemaat Filipi terhadap Paulus itu memberikan dampak yang signifikan terhadap sukacita Paulus.
Lihat Filipi 2:2 “Karena itu sempurnakanlah sukacitaku dengan ini: hendaklah kamu sehati sepikir dalam satu kasih, satu jiwa, satu tujuan” atau dalam Filipi 2:17, “Tetapi sekalipun darahku dicurahkan pada korban dan ibadah imanmu, aku bersukacita dan aku bersukacita dengan kamu sekalian.” Lihat perbandingan dalam 2 Korintus 2:1-3. “1 Aku telah mengambil keputusan di dalam hatiku, bahwa aku tidak akan datang lagi kepadamu dalam dukacita. 2 Sebab, jika aku mendukakan hatimu, siapa lagi yang dapat membuat aku menjadi gembira selain dia yang berdukacita dengan aku. 3 Dan justru itulah maksud suratku ini, yaitu supaya jika aku datang, jangan aku berdukacita oleh mereka, yang harus membuat aku menjadi gembira. Sebab aku yakin tentang kamu semua, bahwa sukacitaku adalah juga sukacitamu.”


Inilah yang dinamakan Pathos. Pathos adalah salah satu teknik retorika yang dipakai di dalam dunia Yunani kuno untuk menggerakkan atau mengekspresikan emosi terhadap pendengar. Biasanya para retors pada zaman Yunani kuno memakai untuk menggerakkan hati para pendengar atau merasakan apa yang dirasakan oleh Para retors. Hanya saja para retors pada zaman Yunani Kuno kebanyakan mereka menggunakan seni retorika sebagai alat mendapatkan keuntungan. Paulus menggunakan Pathos sebagai cara untuk terhubung dengan hati perasaan jemaat Filipi dan mendorong mereka bertumbuh dalam iman mereka.
Paulus mendorong jemaat Filipi untuk bersukacita. Bersukacita senantiasa. Ayat 4 Bersukacitalah senantiasa. Ayat 4 ada karena ayat 3, ada frasa nama-namanya yang tertulis dalam kitab Kehidupan. Itu merupakan sesuatu yang penting. Ini merujuk ke Keluaran 32:32. Orang-orang yang ditulis namanya dalam kitab kehidupan adalah orang-orang yang telah dihapuskan dosanya oleh Allah. Namun Paulus memakai dalam konteks yang berbeda yaitu merujuk pada kepastian keselamatan dalam Kristus dan keselamatan yang akan datang dalam kepenuhan saat Kristus datang. Ingat Paulus berada dalam penjara, kondisi yang pada umum sulit seseorang merasakan sukacita. Pada ayat 4 kita bisa seolah mendengar seruan Paulus untuk mengajak jemaat bersukacita. Dua kali Paulus menuliskan kata perintah untuk bersukacita. Perhatikan frasa, kebaikan hatimu itu dipakai sebagai sebuah pengganti sukacita, dan Paulus menghubungkan ini dengan kedatangan Kristus. Ini merujuk pada Wahyu 19:7, perkawinan Anak Domba dan pengantin-Nya. Ini gambaran pengharapan keselamatan kekal dalam kerajaan Kristus. Gereja-Nya akan dihadirkan di hadapan Kristus, Sang mempelai laki-laki, tak bercacat dan bercela. Sukacita besar akan meliputi setiap orang yang namanya tertulis dalam kitab kehidupan. bahwa kedatangan Kristus yang semakin dekat itu memberikan dorongan sukacita kepada jemaat Filipi.
Ayat 6-ayat 9 merupakan nasihat Paulus kepada jemaat Filipi untuk mereka bisa memiliki kehidupan rohani yang kristen yang baik. Ada tiga nasihat yaitu nasihat tentang kekuatiran ayat 6, pikiran untuk memikirkan hal-hal yang rohani ayat 8, dan kembali pada apa yang telah Paulus ajarkan. Paulus dalam bagian ini menambahkan kata damai sejahtera. Damai sejahtera ini berasal dari Allah dan Sukacita itu juga di dalam Tuhan atau atas apa yang Tuhan kerjakan. Keduanya memiliki sumber dan pusat yang sama yaitu Tuhan.
Bagian ini merupakan nasihat kongkrit bagaimana kehidupan kristen itu harusnya beroperasi. Dimulai dengan bagian dalam diri yang dipenuhi oleh sukacita dan damai dari Tuhan atau dimana Tuhan menjadi pusat dan sumber sukacita yang sejati. Dari dalam itu memancar keluar kepada orang-orang di sekeliling. Paulus mengajak jemaat Filipi untuk bersukacita bersama-sama, bukan hanya seorang diri. Tetapi sebagai sebuah jemaat yang bersukacita karena Tuhan, di dalam Tuhan dan untuk Tuhan. Bukan sebuah perasaan hati yang hanya terpendam di dalam tetapi sukacita itu menjadi kebaikan hati yang dilihat oleh orang lain karena mereka memiliki keselamatan dan sukacita besar sudah menunggu di masa yang akan datang.
Dengan bagian-bagian yang telah kita lihat bersama-sama mulai ayat 1-9, kita sebenar melihat Paulus memberikan argumentasi tidak langsung melawan ajaran legalisme dan juga antinomian /liberal. Paulus mengarahkan kita pada oasis yang sebenarnya yaitu Injil. Ayat 1, dimulai dengan kata penghubung yaitu ‘Karena itu’. Itu merujuk pada pasal 3 mengenai pandangan teologis dan pengalaman Paulus. Ia menggambarkan mengenai pandangannya terhadap Kristus, yang lebih mulia dari kehidupan legalistiknya. Ia pun memberikan pernyataan bahwa kebenaran itu dianugerahkan kepadanya melalui Yesus Kristus. Bukan kebenarannya sendiri tetapi kebenaran Kristus. Tetapi ia juga menyatakan bahwa ia memiliki kehendak yang berbeda setelah anugerah Kristus itu diberikan. Kehendak untuk mengenal Kristus. Natur yang baru. Pada titik ini Paulus melawan pandangan antinomian/liberal, yang hidup tak sekehendak hatinya dan terus menerus melakukan dosa. Tetapi hidup menjadi serupa dengan Kristus dalam kematian-Nya, itu artinya mengejar keserupaan dengan Kristus di dalam hidupnya.
Inilah oasis Sukacita Paulus, Injil yang telah mentransformasi dirinya dari dalam. Paulus sang legalis, namun disisi satu karena legalismenya itu dia menjadi orang yang antinomian dengan membunuh orang lain, menjadi seorang melihat pengenalan akan Kristus itu lebih utama dari lain. Pandangan hidupnya (worldview)nya berubah karena Injil. Bahkan ketika ada orang-orang yang memberitakan Injil dengan motif yang tidak benar dan tulus, ia mampu bersukacita karena Kristus tetapi diberitakan. Baik ketika dia ada dalam penjara, mungkin ini relevan dengan kita; kita juga terpenjara dalam arrti yang berbeda. Kita harus tinggal dirumah lebih banyak. Bisakah kita tetap bersukacita bukan atas dasar kondisi kita tetapi karena oasis Injil, atas apa yang telah Allah kerjakan dan terus kerjakan di dalam kita?

Corrie Ten Boom adalah seorang yang pernah ditahan dalam kamp konsentrasi karena ketahuan oleh tentara Nazi menyelamatkan ratusan orang Yahudi dari Holocaust. Dia berkata :”Yesus tidak berjanji untuk mengubah keadaan di sekitar kita. Dia menjanjikan kedamaian yang besar dan sukacita yang murni bagi mereka yang mau belajar untuk percaya bahwa Tuhan benar-benar mengendalikan segala sesuatu.”

Persiapkan Jalan untuk Tuhan
Yohanes 1:6-8, 22-28

6 Datanglah seorang yang diutus Allah, namanya Yohanes; 7 ia datang sebagai saksi untuk memberi kesaksian tentang terang itu, supaya oleh dia semua orang menjadi percaya. 8 Ia bukan terang itu, tetapi ia harus memberi kesaksian tentang terang itu.
19 Dan inilah kesaksian Yohanes ketika orang Yahudi dari Yerusalem mengutus beberapa imam dan orang-orang Lewi kepadanya untuk menanyakan dia: “Siapakah engkau?”
20 Ia mengaku dan tidak berdusta, katanya: “Aku bukan Mesias. ” 21 Lalu mereka bertanya kepadanya: “Kalau begitu, siapakah engkau? Elia?” Dan ia menjawab: “Bukan!” “Engkaukah nabi yang akan datang?” Dan ia menjawab: “Bukan!”
22 Maka kata mereka kepadanya: “Siapakah engkau? Sebab kami harus memberi jawab kepada mereka yang mengutus kami. Apakah katamu tentang dirimu sendiri?” 23 Jawabnya: “Akulah suara orang yang berseru-seru di padang gurun: Luruskanlah jalan Tuhan! seperti yang telah dikatakan nabi Yesaya.” 24 Dan di antara orang-orang yang diutus itu ada beberapa orang Farisi. 25 Mereka bertanya kepadanya, katanya: “Mengapakah engkau membaptis, jikalau engkau bukan Mesias, bukan Elia, dan bukan nabi yang akan datang?” 26 Yohanes menjawab mereka, katanya: “Aku membaptis dengan air; tetapi di tengah-tengah kamu berdiri Dia yang tidak kamu kenal, 27 yaitu Dia, yang datang kemudian dari padaku. Membuka tali kasut-Nyapun aku tidak layak.” 28 Hal itu terjadi di Betania yang di seberang sungai Yordan, di mana Yohanes membaptis.

Peranan Yohanes pembaptis bukan Mesias, Elia dan bukan nabi yang akan datang juga, dia adalah saksi terang itu. Kata saksi bukan bicara mengenai dirinya sendiri tetapi apa yang dia saksikan mengenai sebuah kejadian atau tentang seseorang. Kesaksian seorang saksi sangat penting dalam sebuah persidangan. Nyawa seorang saksi bisa terancam karena kesaksiannya. Namun, kesaksiannya itu sangat penting untuk mengungkapkan kebenaran yang sesungguhnya terhadap sebuah kejadian atau seseorang. Jika seseorang memberikan kesaksian yang negative / keliru tentang diri Anda di dalam sebuah persidangan maka keputusan persidangan itu pun dapat dipengaruhi oleh kesaksian saksi tersebut. Sekali lagi kesaksian seorang saksi bukan tentang dirinya tetapi tentang kejadian atau orang lain yang dia saksikan. Tentu dia punya kesaksian tentang dirinya sendiri, paling tidak identitas dasarnya, tetapi itupun selalu dihubungkan dengan kejadian atau sosok yang dia sedang saksikan.


Kehadiran Yohanes sebagai saksi memberikan sebuah fenomena yang luar biasa. Para Imam, orang Lewi dan Farisi datang bertanya kepada dia. Mereka bertanya mengenai identitasnya. Inilah kira-kira yang mereka tanyakan : “Siapakah kamu? Kami tahu ada nubuatan tentang Mesias, Elia dan Nabi yang akan datang, apakah kamu salah satu dari ketiga kategori itu?” Pertanyaan ini menunjukkan mengenai harapan para imam, lewi dan farisi berkaitan dengan kehadiran Yohanes Pembaptis. Mereka mengharapkan salah satu dari 3 kategori itu. Tetapi kejutan menanti mereka. Yohanes pembaptis berkata :”Aku bukan dari ketiga kategori tersebut”. Seringkali ketika harapan kita dipenuhi oleh seseorang maka kita akan berbahagia. Tetapi bagaimana ketika harapan tersebut tidak terpenuhi? Yohanes Pembaptis tidak memenuhi harapan mereka. Kata Bukan diucapkan sebanyak 3 kali. “Aku BUKAN Mesias, BUKAN Elia dan BUKAN nabi yang akan datang.” BUKAN, BUKAN, BUKAN.
Kata saksi dalam Perjanjian Lama disebutkan dalam Ulangan 17:6 dan Matius 18:16, yaitu kesaksian dari tiga orang saksi perkara tidak disangsikan. Jawaban Yohanes mengenai siapakan dirinya dijawab dengan tiga kali jawaban. Pengulangan sebanyak tiga merupakan sesuatu yang penting dan harus kita perhatikan. Dalam hal ini Yohanes pembaptis, menjawab dengan tegas bahwa ia bukan Elia, bukan Mesias dan bukan nabi yang akan datang. Bukan Elia memang dia bukan Elia. Tetapi dia memiliki peran yang mirip dengan Elia yaitu membawa pembaharuan. Elia mengajak Israel untuk menyembah Tuhan bukan Baal. Sedangkan Yohanes Pembaptis tidak berhadapan dengan para penyembah Baal seperti yang terjadi di zaman Elia tetapi Yohanes Pembaptis berhadapan dengan para pemimpin Yahudi, orang-orang farisi yang membuat sistem keagamaan yang korup. Jawaban Yohanes Pembaptis ini menunjukkan ketegasan integritasnya sebagai saksi. Yohanes seperti jembatan antara Perjanjian Lama dan Perjanjian Baru. Para ahli mengatakan seolah kaki Yohanes Pembaptis ini berdiri di dua zaman yaitu zaman janji-janji diberikan dan zaman penggenapan janji-janji tersebut. Kesaksiannya adalah kesaksian dari Perjanjian Lama dan dia juga menjadi saksi sebuah Perjanjian Baru yang terjadi di zamannya dengan kedatangan Kristus.
Dia adalah saksi yang menyuarakan dan menyerukan pertobatan dari padang gurun dan di Sungai Yordan. Padang gurun dan Sungai Yordan disebutkan dalam bacaan kita hari ini. Mengapa kedua tempat ini penting? Penting karena kedua tempat ini berkaitan dengan pembaptisan atau konsekrasi Israel dan permulaan baru bagi Israel ketika mereka memasuki Tanah Kanaan. Padang Gurun merupakan pengingat akan keluarnya bangsa Israel dari Mesir dan masuk ke Padang Gurun melalui Laut Merah. Tuhan membelah Laut Merah dan menyediakan jalan bagi Israel untuk menyebrang. Musa mengulurkan tangannya ke atas laut maka semalaman Tuhan menguak air laut dengan perantaraan angin timur yang keras membuat laut itu kering maka terbelahlah air laut itu. Melalui jalan tersebut Bangsa Israel menyebrangi Laut Teberau dan masuk ke Padang Gurun. Sungai Yordan sebagai pengingat akan masuknya Bangsa Israel ke Tanah Kanaan. Yosua memimpin Bangsa Israel masuk ke Tanah Kanaan dengan menyebrangi Sungai Yordan. Pada waktu mereka menyebrangi Sungai Yordan, sungai tersebut terbelah jadi dua dan Bangsa Israel berjalan di tanah yang kering mirip dengan apa yang terjadi di ketika mereka menyebrangi Laut Teberau. Jadi pesan yang ingin coba disampaikan ketika dua tempat ini disebut adalah sebagai fungsi literal dan simbolis. Pengingat terhadap peristiwa Allah melakukan penyelamatan / karya keselamatan bagi Bangsa Israel. Dengan kata lain :”Persiapkanlah dirimu, hai bangsa Israel, karena sekarang aku (Yohanes) sedang ingin memperkenalkan keselamatan itu”.


Baptisan Yohanes merupakan sebuah bentuk persiapan hati untuk menerima keselamatan yang akan segera datang. Orang yang menerima baptisan Yohanes kemudian juga ada yang menjadi para murid Yesus. Pada baptisan Yohanes ada suara panggilan pertobatan untuk mempersiapkan diri akan kedatangan Mesias. Kita dibaptis sebagai sebuah tanda lahiriah akan anugerah batiniah yang telah kita terima dari Kristus. Orang yang dibaptis karena mereka sudah memberikan diri mereka sepenuh hidup mereka untuk mengikut Kristus. Baptisan adalah tanda luar akan anugerah yng ada di dalam kita. Nah, panggilan pertobatan inilah diserukan oleh Yohanes dan berita kedatangan Kristus yang akan membaptis dengan Roh Kudus dan api. Gambaran baptisan air dan Roh Kudus ini bicara mengenai tanda luar dan tanda di dalam. Air membersihkan bagian luar tubuh tetapi Roh Kudus membersihkan bagian terdalam hati manusia. Jadi seruan pertobatan itu dibarengi dengan seruan kabar baik. Bukan hanya seruan keluar dari dosa tetapi seruan masuk ke dalam keselamatan yang Allah sediakan melalui Kristus.


Lihatlah bagaimana Yohanes Pembaptis merendahkan dirinya ketika berbicara mengenai Kristus. Budaya pada zaman itu, pekerjaan untuk membuka tali kasut bukanlah sesuatu yang biasa, juga dikalangan budak-budak orang Yahudi. Para budak saja tidak melakukan pekerjaan semacam itu. Lalu apa maksudnya? Yohanes merendahkan dirinya serendah-rendahnya karena Dia menyadari kemuliaan dan keagungan Kristus. Kemuliaan dan keagungan inilah yang dilihat oleh Yohanes Pembaptis sehingga ia mengungkapkan pernyataan seperti itu. Dengan pernyataan ini juga sebenarnya Yohanes pembaptis memang berperan sebagai saksi dan pembuka jalan untuk memperkenalkan Kristus pada dunia. Yohanes Pembaptis memanggil orang-orang untuk mempersiapkan diri mereka untuk menyambut kedatangan Kristus. Sikap yang ditunjukkan oleh Yohanes Pembaptis merupakan sebuah gestur yang dinyatakan jelas bahwa dia sendiri pun merendahkan diri-Nya dan mempersiapkan hatinya di hadapan Tuhan menjelang kedatangan Kristus.


Persiapan hati dalam pertobatan menjadi sangat penting dalam menyambut kedatangan Kristus. Pada kedatangan Kristus yang pertama, Yohanes Pembaptis menyerukan pertobatan. Pada kedatangan-Nya yang kedua, seruan yang sama pun masih tetap relevan. Luruskanlah jalan bagi Tuhan. Luruskanlah hati mu. Luruskanlah motivasimu. Di dalam Lukas 3:10-14, hasil dari seruan pertobatan yang disampaikan oleh Yohanes Pembaptis paling tidak ada 3 respon yaitu Orang banyak, pemungut-pemungut cukai dan prajurit-prajurit. Kepada orang banyak Yohanes Pembaptis bicara mengenai ketamakan, jika seseorang punya 2 helai baju, hendaklah ia membaginya. Kepada Pemungut-pemungut cukai, Yohanes Pembaptis bicara mengenai ketidakjujuran, jangan menagih lebih dari yang telah ditetapkan. Kepada para prajurit, Yohanes Pembaptis bicara ketidakadilan, jangan rampas barang milik orang lain dan cukuplah dirimu dengan gajimu.


Ketamakan adalah ketika kita memiliki lebih dari cukup dan kita tidak mau berbagi. Tidak dikatakan bahwa ketika seseorang memiliki 1 helai baju maka ia harus membagikan kepada orang lain. Tetapi ketika seseorang memiliki 2 helai baju maka dia harus membagikannya kepada orang lain. Hal ini tentu berlaku bukan hanya pakaian tetapi makanan atau hal lainnya.
Ketidakjujuran yang dimaksudkan oleh Yohanes Pembaptis berkaitan dengan memeras orang lain.

Ketidakjujuran salah satu yang menonjol di Indonesia adalah korupsi. Indonesia memiliki komisi khusus untuk pemberantasan korupsi. Beberapa hari yang lalu menteri sosial Indonesia pun ditetapkan menjadi tersangka korupsi bantuan sosial. Uang yang dikorupsi memang dalam jumlah sedikit tetapi karena bantuan sosial ini sangat massif maka uang yang kecil itu terakumulasi jadi sangat besar. Pemerasan dan korupsi memiliki akar yang sama ketidakjujuran. Transparansi keuangan harus menjadi sebuah perhatian penting dalam sebuah organisasi apalagi gereja. Jika tidak ada transparansi keuangan maka sulit kita bisa mengatakan bahwa organisasi tersebut berdasarkan pada nilai-nilai Firman Tuhan atau disebut Kristen.


Ketidakadilan, merampas barang milik orang lain adalah mengambil barang milik orang lain dengan paksaan atau kekerasan. Ini jelas pelanggaran hukum ke 8 dan 10, Jangan mencuri dan menginginkan milik orang lain.
Ketiga dosa ini bukan hanya bicara hubungan dengan sesama. Tetapi ketika terjadi kerusakan hubungan antara sesama manusia maka hubungan dengan Tuhan pun dapat dipastikan rusak. Ketika seseorang menempatkan barang atau hal lain sebagai prioritas terutama maka dia sudah melanggar perintah pertama dan kedua.

Ada sebuah kutipan yang bisa menolong kita melihat diri kita dan apa yang telah Kristus lakukan bagi kita. Ini berkaitan erat dengan pengampunan dan pertobatan di dalam Kristus. Hanya oleh Kristus jugalah kita mampu menghasilkan buah pertobatan yang sejati.

Demikian kutipan tersebut: “We never deserve heaven by leaving off our sins; it is Christ who has purchased heaven by his blood to bestow it on those who believe in his name. But if we do really believe we shall bring forth good fruit and forsake our sins. It is God alone who can change our hearts but we must not wait until we feel right feelings, before we begin to act right. We must avoid everything that we know to be wrong, and entreat God to overcome the evil feelings of our hearts, (which we cannot subdue,) and to enable us to do that which is pleasing in his sight.” (Favell Lee Mortimer : Luke 3:10-14. )

Aku Hidup karena Kristus
Yohanes 6:35,41-51

35 Kata Yesus kepada mereka: “Akulah roti hidup; barangsiapa datang kepada-Ku, ia tidak akan lapar lagi, dan barangsiapa percaya kepada-Ku, ia tidak akan haus lagi.
41 Maka bersungut-sungutlah orang Yahudi tentang Dia, karena Ia telah mengatakan: “Akulah roti yang telah turun dari sorga.” 42 Kata mereka: “Bukankah Ia ini Yesus, anak Yusuf, yang ibu bapanya kita kenal? Bagaimana Ia dapat berkata: Aku telah turun dari sorga?” 43 Jawab Yesus kepada mereka: “Jangan kamu bersungut-sungut. 44 Tidak ada seorangpun yang dapat datang kepada-Ku, jikalau ia tidak ditarik oleh Bapa yang mengutus Aku, dan ia akan Kubangkitkan pada akhir zaman. 45 Ada tertulis dalam kitab nabi-nabi: Dan mereka semua akan diajar oleh Allah. Dan setiap orang, yang telah mendengar dan menerima pengajaran dari Bapa, datang kepada-Ku. 46 Hal itu tidak berarti, bahwa ada orang yang telah melihat Bapa. Hanya Dia yang datang dari Allah, Dialah yang telah melihat Bapa. 47 Aku berkata kepadamu: Sesungguhnya barangsiapa percaya, ia mempunyai hidup yang kekal. 48 Akulah roti hidup. 49 Nenek moyangmu telah makan manna di padang gurun dan mereka telah mati. 50 Inilah roti yang turun dari sorga: Barangsiapa makan dari padanya, ia tidak akan mati. 51 Akulah roti hidup yang telah turun dari sorga. Jikalau seorang makan dari roti ini, ia akan hidup selama-lamanya, dan roti yang Kuberikan itu ialah daging-Ku, yang akan Kuberikan untuk hidup dunia.

Kita makan untuk hidup. Bukan hidup untuk makan. Kehidupan kita ini ditopang oleh makanan. Ketergantungan kita terhadap makanan merupakan sebuah gambaran yang seharusnya kita renungkan karena ketergantungan ini seumur hidup kita.
Ada yang salah paham mengenai perkataan Yesus bahwa manusia hidup dari setiap Firman Tuhan yang keluar dari mulut Tuhan. Ini pandangan yang keliru karena perkataan yang sebenarnya tidak seperti demikian. Yesus berkata :”Ada tertulis : Manusia hidup bukan dari roti saja, tetapi dari setiap firman yang keluar dari mulut Allah” (Matius 4:4)Yang adalah kutipan dari Ulangan 8:3. Bahkan ini lebih menarik bahwa di balik perkataan Yesus ini ada sebuah indikasi yang menghubungkan tema inkarnasi dengan pernyataan Yesus sebagai Akulah Roti Hidup. Yesus adalah Firman Allah yang turun menjadi manusia (Yohanes 1:1-14) dan daging serta darah-Nya itu menjadi makanan bagi orang-orang yang percaya-Nya (Yohanes 6:35). Itulah mengapa Yesus bisa bertahan di dalam pencobaan di Padang Gurun karena Dialah Sang Roti Hidup itu sendiri, self sufficient.


Jadi makanan memang yang harus kita makan seumur hidup kita untuk menopang kebutuhan tubuh kita berasal dari Allah, sang Sumber kehidupan. Karena sebenarnya Yesus pun mengatakan Akulah Roti HIdup itu. Hubungan makanan jasmani tidak dapat dipisahkan dengan makanan rohani. Yesus menekankan pada hubungan antara makanan dan kehidupan. Lalu apa maksud Yesus sebenarnya? Untuk mengetahui ini kita harus melihat sebuah perbandingan berdasarkan apa yang Yesus sampaikan dan Kitab-kitab Musa mengenai Manna untuk Israel di Padang Gurun dengan diri-Nya sebagai Roti Hidup.

Manna
Yesus menyatakan bahwa Manna itu adalah roti dari sorga (Yohanes 6 :31). Berdasarkan keterangan dari Perjanjian Lama, “Manna ini warnanya putih seperti ketumbar dan rasanya seperti rasa kue madu” (Keluaran 16:31). Mereka memungutnya setiap pagi, setiap orang 1 gomer atau setara dengan 3,6 liter. Pada hari keenam mereka memungut 2 gomer sebagai makanan di hari Sabat. “Orang Israel makan Manna selama 40 tahunnya sampai mereka tiba di tanah yang didiami orang; mereka makan Manna sampai tiba di perbatasan tanah Kanaan” (Keluaran 16:35). Manna tidak kekal melainkan bisa berulat dan berbau dalam satu hari. Terbatas waktunya ketika matahari bersinar cairlah Manna ini. Bangsa Israel makan namun mereka mati ( Yohanes 6:49). Jadi manna ini adalah roti yang dari Tuhan untuk menjadi makanan bangsa Israel sebagai bentuk ketergantungan mereka terhadap Tuhan selama di Padang Gurun.

Roti hidup
Lalu apa maksud Yesus sebagai Roti Hidup yang turun dari Sorga? Yesus menyatakan bahwa diri-Nya adalah Roti Hidup yang turun dari Sorga. Firman itu telah menjadi manusia/daging (Yohanes 1:14). Ia tidak dapat binasa/makanan yang tidak binasa, bertahan sampai hidup yang kekal, atau makanan sejati. Setiap orang yang percaya kepada-Nya tidak akan lapar (dan haus) lagi. Mereka yang makan/percaya (Yohanes 6:29), kepada-Nya tidak akan binasa. Mereka akan hidup selamanya, beroleh hidup yang kekal. Mereka tinggal di dalam Kristus, Kristus di dalam dia dan mereka akan dibangkitkan pada hari terakhir.

Kristus dan Kita
Yesus memakai Manna/roti untuk menjelaskan hubungan antar diri-Nya sebagai Pemberi kehidupan. Dialah juga yang memberikan roti dan ikan kepada ribuan orang. Sehingga mereka kenyang bahkan ada sisa 12 bakul, tetapi ketika mereka lapar mereka datang lagi kepada Yesus, kali ini mereka bersungut-sungut. Mereka dia dapat menerima pengajaran Yesus karena Dia menganggap diriNya sebagai orang yang telah turun dari Sorga serta orang-orang bertanya bagaimana Ia ini dapat memberikan daging-Nya kepada kita untuk dimakan?.

Murid-murid-Nya pun bersungut-sungut tentang hal ini. Ini sebuah perkataan yang keras. Pernyataan Yesus membuat banyak murid-murid-Nya mengundurkan diri dan tidak lagi mengikuti Dia (Yohanes 6:66), kecuali 12 orang murid-Nya. 11 murid percaya tetapi 1 akan mengkhianati-Nya. Mereka yang tidak percaya kepada Kristus akan binasa dan mereka yang percaya akan hidup bahkan hidup selamanya di dalam Kristus dan Kristus di dalam mereka.

Lalu bagaimana kita memaknai hal ini apakah memang Yesus itu lebih penting dari makanan jasmani kita? Ataukah Dia adalah sang pemberi hidup kita baik di dunia dan dunia yang akan datang? Jawabannya jelas bahwa Tuhan Yesus adalah sumber kehidupan sejati baik di dunia ini dan dunia yang akan datang. Dari kehidupan ini sampai kehidupan kekal. Dialah memberikan makanan bagi kita dan Dialah juga “makanan” yang sejati itu untuk hidup selamanya.

Sama seperti tubuh kita tergantung sepenuhnya kepada makanan jasmani demikianlah sebenarnya seluruh hidup kita seharusnya bergantung pada Allah, karena Dialah Sang Hidup. Ada orang yang memiliki tubuh karena dia makan, sehingga dia hidup, tetapi ada orang yang makan yang cukup tapi tetap merasa lapar. Lapar akan kasih, pengakuan, pengampunan, harta, kuasa dan lain-lain, karena mereka tidak memiliki Kristus. Persekutuan kita dalam dan dengan Kristus yang menjadi sumber kehidupan kita sehari-hari. Tidak ada yang dapat mengalami hidup yang kekal atau sejati jika mereka di luar Kristus.
Kita hidup dan bernafas karena Kristus memberikan hidup bagi kita. Kehidupan jasmani dan atau rohani semuanya itu bersumber pada Kristus, Sang Roti HIdup. Kita hanya bisa menikmati separuh kehidupan bila hanya sekedar hidup jasmani saja. Hanya di dalam Kristus kita mengalami hidup yang sejati. Tentu hidup jasmani tidak selalu baik, kita bisa sakit, kita bisa mati, tetapi kehidupan yang kita jalani karena iman di dalam Kristus lebih besar dan berharga nilainya dari hanya sekedar hidup jasmaniah biasa. HIdup dalam Kristus dipenuhi kasih, pengampunan, kebenaran dan penerimaan penuh dari diri-Nya. Kita bisa berjalan bersama Kristus melewati lembah kekelaman/air mata dan bahkan di hadapan lawan pun Tuhan menyiapkan hidangan bagi kita. Jiwa kita disegarkan karena Kristus ada di dalam Kita.
Tidak ada ruang yang memisahkan kita dari kasih kristus (Roma 8:35 & 39), tetapi kita malah berbagi ruang dengan Allah Tritunggal. Paulus melukiskan persatuan kita dengan Kristus bukan sesuatu yang bisa dipisahkan. Tidak ada yang bisa memisahkan kita dengan Kristus. Kata yang dipakai adalah Khorizo, berasal dari akar kata Khora artinya ada ruang pemisah. Sedangkan kita yang percaya karena Roh yang membangkitkan Yesus Kristus dari antara orang mati, ada di dalam kita, Roh yang sama itu pun akan menghidupkan juga tubuh kita yang fana itu oleh Roh-Nya (Roma 8:11). Sehingga kita tidak terpisah dari Kristus oleh apapun. Ruang pemisah seperti penindasan, kesesakan, penganiayaan, kelaparan, ketelanjangan, bahaya atau pedang tidak mampu memisahkan kita. Malahan melalui ruang-ruang itulah kita berbagi ruang dengan Kristus karena Kristus bersama dalam ruang-ruang itu atau Dia ber-Perikhoresis, karena Kristus didalam kita. Kristus itu dalam Allah Bapa dan Roh. Maka kita di dalam Allah Tritunggal. Allah Tritunggal berada dalam ruang-ruang penindasan, kesesakan, penganiayaan, dan seterusnya.

Hidup di dalam Kristus seperti sarung tangan yang membutuhkan tangan untuk menggerakankannya.


Di atas meja terdapat sebuah sarung tangan. Ini adalah sebuah “work gloves,” sebuah sarung tangan yang didesain untuk bekerja—untuk mengangkat, membangun, dan melakukan banyak pekerjaan lain nya.
Lalu saya bilang ke sarung tangan tersebut, “Hai sarung tangan, angkat buku itu!”
… … … Tidak terjadi apa-apa.

Mungkin sarung tangan ini membutuhkan sebuah motivasi. “Ayo sarung tangan, kamu pasti bisa! Kamu diciptakan untuk mengangkat buku itu!”
… … … Tetap tidak terjadi apa-apa.

Mungkin sarung tangan ini butuh sebuah pengajaran bagaimana cara mengangkat buku itu. “Ayo sarung tangan, jadi begini caranya, kamu pegang buku itu disini, dan eratkan jari-jari mu seperti ini.”
… … … Tetap tidak bisa.

Mungkin sarung tangan ini membutuhkan sebuah fellowship. Ayo kita kumpulkan sarung tangan lain nya di dekat sarung tangan ini, dan lihat apa yang terjadi.
… … … Tetap tidak ada apa-apa.


Demikian hidup kita tanpa Kristus…tidak ada apa-apa. Tetapi jika Kristus di dalam kita maka kita mampu melakukan sesuatu bahkan lebih dari apa yang kita bisa pikirkan sebelumnya.

Kebenaran tidak akan bisa mati
Markus 6:14-29

Asal muasal kebencian Herodias kepada Yohanes Pembaptis


17 Sebab memang Herodeslah yang menyuruh orang menangkap Yohanes dan membelenggunya di penjara berhubung dengan peristiwa Herodias, isteri Filipus saudaranya, karena Herodes telah mengambilnya sebagai isteri. 18 Karena Yohanes pernah menegor Herodes: “Tidak halal engkau mengambil isteri saudaramu!” 19 Karena itu Herodias menaruh dendam pada Yohanes dan bermaksud untuk membunuh dia, tetapi tidak dapat, 20 sebab Herodes segan akan Yohanes karena ia tahu, bahwa Yohanes adalah orang yang benar dan suci, jadi ia melindunginya. Tetapi apabila ia mendengarkan Yohanes, hatinya selalu terombang-ambing, namun ia merasa senang juga mendengarkan dia.

Sekilas latar belakang sejarah keluarga besar Herodes Antipas
Untuk memahaminya kisah ini Herodes Antipas, kita harus melihat kompleksnya pernikahan Herodes Agung, kita perlu tahu sedikit tentang karakternya. Ketika Yesus lahir, Herodes Agung adalah raja. Dialah yang bertanggung jawab atas pembantaian anak-anak di Betlehem. Herodes Agung menikah berkali-kali. Menjelang akhir hidupnya ia menjadi paranoid, membunuh banyak anggota keluarganya sendiri. Dikatakan tentang dia, “Lebih aman menjadi babi Herodes daripada anak Herodes.”
Herodes Agung memiliki total lima istri. Dari salah satu dari mereka, Mariamne Hasmonean, ia memiliki seorang putra bernama Aristobulus. Aristobulus akhirnya dibunuh oleh Herodes Agung, tetapi tidak sebelum dia memiliki seorang putri bernama Herodias. Herodes Agung memiliki putra lain yang kita kenal sebagai Herodes Filipus yang ibunya adalah Mariamne dari Boethusian. Herodes Filipus akhirnya menikahi Herodias; oleh Herodias, ia memiliki seorang putri bernama Salome.
Herodes Agung memiliki dua putra dari seorang istri bernama Malthake. Putra-putranya adalah Arkhelaus dan Herodes Antipas, yang merupakan Herodes di bagian kita dan yang merupakan penguasa Galilea. Herodes Filipus, yang awalnya menikah dengan Herodias dan yang merupakan ayah dari Salome, tidak mewarisi kekuasaan Herodes Agung. Dia hidup sebagai warga negara kaya di Roma.
Herodes Antipas, Herodes dalam teks kita hari ini, mengunjunginya di Roma. Di sana dia merayu Herodias dan membujuknya untuk meninggalkan suaminya dan menikah dengannya. Lihat betapa rumit dan insesnya semua ini. Herodes Antipas terlibat dalam hubungan perzinahan dengan keponakannya sendiri yang pada saat yang sama adalah istri dari saudara tirinya dan karena itu saudara iparnya. Untuk memperumit cerita bahkan lebih, Herodes Agung akhirnya menikahi seorang wanita bernama Cleopatra dari Yerusalem dengan siapa ia memiliki seorang putra bernama Philip the Tetrarch. Philip ini kemudian menikahi Salome yang pada saat yang sama adalah keponakan dan cucunya.
Selain Markus 6:14-29 kita yang lain yaitu Amos 7:7-15 dan Efesus 1:3-14 memiliki benang merah (Silver lining) yang sama yaitu pemberita Firman Kebenaran, tetapi hari ini kita akan hanya membahas Markus 6:14-29. Meskipun kondisi keluarga Herodes Agung sangat rumit Yohanes pembaptis tetap menyatakan kebenaran Firman Allah kepada Herodes Antipas. Suara kebenaran Yohanes Pembaptis bukan berdasarkan pada sebuah suka atau tidaknya dia terhadap Herodes Antipas. Tetapi dia mendasarkan teguran kerasnnya terhadap Herodes Antipas atas dasar Firman Tuhan yaitu pada perintah yang ke sepuluh (Keluaran 20:17 “Jangan mengingini isteri sesamamu…”dan Imamat 18:16 “Janganlah kausingkapkan aurat isteri saudaramu laki-laki, karena itu hak saudaramu laki-laki. 20:21 Bila seorang laki-laki mengambil isteri saudaranya, itu suatu kecemaran, karena ia melanggar hak saudaranya laki-laki, dan mereka akan tidak beranak.) Firman kebenaran ini merupakan suara Allah yang disampaikan melalui suara dan hidup Yohanes Pembaptis. Firman kebenaran ini bukan berasal dari dirinya sendiri tetapi dari hukum Allah kepada umat-Nya. Ini bukan sebuah penghakiman manusia tetapi penghakiman dari Allah mengenai kehidupan Herodes Antipas yang menyimpang dari hukum Allah.
Terlepas dari rumitnya dosa yang terjadi dalam sejarah kehidupan Herodes Antipas, ia tetap mengenali Yohanes Pembaptis sebagai orang yang memiliki kehidupan yang benar dan suci. Hal ini adalah alasan mengapa Herodes Antipas segan dengan Yohanes Pembaptis. Dengan kata lain Herodes Antipas tidak menemukan kesalahan apapun dari Yohanes Pembaptis yang layak untuk dihukum mati. Tetapi walapun begitu Herodes Antipas pun tidak mau Yohanes Pembaptis menyampaikan Firman Kebenaran itu kepada lebih banyak orang sehingga ia memenjarakan Yohanes Pembaptis. Di sisi lain Herodias malah berniat untuk membunuhnya. Dia menunggu dan merencanakan kesempatan untuk membunuh Yohanes Pembaptis.

Strategi menyingkirkan Yohanes Pembaptis (Rasa hormat publik dan kesenangan sesaat)
21 Akhirnya tiba juga kesempatan yang baik bagi Herodias, ketika Herodes pada hari ulang tahunnya mengadakan perjamuan untuk pembesar-pembesarnya, perwira-perwiranya dan orang-orang terkemuka di Galilea. 22 Pada waktu itu anak perempuan Herodias tampil lalu menari, dan ia menyukakan hati Herodes dan tamu-tamunya. Raja berkata kepada gadis itu: “Minta dari padaku apa saja yang kauingini, maka akan kuberikan kepadamu!”, 23 lalu bersumpah kepadanya: “Apa saja yang kauminta akan kuberikan kepadamu, sekalipun setengah dari kerajaanku! ” 24 Anak itu pergi dan menanyakan ibunya: “Apa yang harus kuminta?” Jawabnya: “Kepala Yohanes Pembaptis!” 25 Maka cepat-cepat ia pergi kepada raja dan meminta: “Aku mau, supaya sekarang juga engkau berikan kepadaku kepala Yohanes Pembaptis di sebuah talam!” 26 Lalu sangat sedihlah hati raja, tetapi karena sumpahnya dan karena tamu-tamunya ia tidak mau menolaknya.
Kata kesempatan yang disebutkan dalam ayat 21, merupakan sebuah petunjuk untuk kita melihat kemungkinan bahwa semua yang dilakukan dalam pesta ulang tahun Herodes ini sudah diatur oleh Herodias. Perjamuan makan ini bukan hanya dihadiri keluarga raja tetapi juga tamu-tamu dari luar. Hiburan yang ditampilkan di pesta itu adalah tarian dari anak Herodias yaitu Salome. Tarian merupakan sebuah hiburan yang lazim ditemukan dalam pesta-pesta bangsawan romawi. Tarian ini bukan tarian biasa tetapi cenderung erotis dan sensual. Tarian ini sengaja ditampilkan untuk menarik hati para penonton yang melihatnya sehingga mereka terbius dengan tarian itu dan suasana pesta yang terjadi. Target dari tarian ini adalah Herodes Antipas sehingga hasil akhir dari tarian ini adalah ketika raja bertanya :”Minta dari padaku apa saja yang kauingini, maka akan kuberikan kepadamu!” bahkan ia bersumpah kepada penari itu, Salome. Ia bersumpah memberikan setengah kerajaannya. Ketika raja bertanya dan bersumpah Salome pergi atau lari bertanya kepada ibunya. Herodias, ibunya, berkata “Kepala Yohanes Pembaptis” jawaban singkat ini merupakan sebuah indikasi bahwa ia tidak mau menyia-nyiakan waktu. Sikap yang sama pun ditunjukkan Salome ketika menjawab Herodes Antipas. Salome mengatakan “Aku mau, supaya sekarang juga engkau berikan kepadaku kepala Yohanes Pembaptis di sebuah talam!”. Kepala Yohanes Pembaptis disajikan dalam sebuah piring. Ini memberikan gambaran sebuah ketergesaan atau desakan tinggi untuk permintaan itu ditindaklanjuti segera.

Herodes segera memenggal kepala Yohanes Pembaptis
27 Raja segera menyuruh seorang pengawal dengan perintah supaya mengambil kepala Yohanes. Orang itu pergi dan memenggal kepala Yohanes di penjara. 28 Ia membawa kepala itu di sebuah talam dan memberikannya kepada gadis itu dan gadis itu memberikannya pula kepada ibunya. 29 Ketika murid-murid Yohanes mendengar hal itu mereka datang dan mengambil mayatnya, lalu membaringkannya dalam kuburan.
Respon Herodes Antipas yang segera melaksanakan permintaan Salome dan Herodes itu merupakan sebuah tanda bahwa hati Herodes Antipas sudah terjerat dosa. Jika kita menarik kesimpulan dari kisah perjamuan ini maka perjamuan dan tarian Salome itu bukan hanya membuat Herodes tertarik hatinya kepada Salome tetapi menaruh seluruh semua yang ia memiliki untuk digunakan oleh Salome. Kebenaran dan kesucian hidup sudah ditinggalkan Herodes Antipas demi sebuah kesenangan sesaat. Ia mempertaruhkan dirinya dan kerajaannya kepada permintaan Salome. Ini memberikan gambaran kontras dengan kehidupan dan berita kebenaran yang disampaikan oleh Yohanes Pembaptis. Hal ini sebagai sebuah penegasan bahwa Herodes Antipas tidak berpihak pada kebenaran.

Yesus dianggap sebagai Yohanes Pembaptis yang bangkit. Kuasa-kuasa itu bekerja di dalam diri-Nya
“14 Raja Herodes juga mendengar tentang Yesus, sebab nama-Nya sudah terkenal dan orang mengatakan: “Yohanes Pembaptis sudah bangkit dari antara orang mati dan itulah sebabnya kuasa-kuasa itu bekerja di dalam Dia.” 15 Yang lain mengatakan: “Dia itu Elia!” Yang lain lagi mengatakan: “Dia itu seorang nabi sama seperti nabi-nabi yang dahulu.” 16 Waktu Herodes mendengar hal itu, ia berkata: “Bukan, dia itu Yohanes yang sudah kupenggal kepalanya, dan yang bangkit lagi.”
Tetapi kisah kehidupan Yohanes Pembaptis yang telah berakhir dan kegagalan Herodes Antipas dalam dosanya, bukan berarti berakhir pula kebenaran dan kerajaan Allah. Dari pernyataan Herodes Antipas kita melihat sebuah keyakinan yang mungkin tidak disadarinya. Kebenaran yang dipahami oleh Herodes Antipas yaitu bahwa kebenaran itu tidak akan mati. Sebuah rujukan pada “kebangkitan” Yohanes Pembaptis tetapi juga rujukan pada kebangkitan Kristus. Tiada ada yang dapat menghalangi kebenaran.
Yesus Kristus, Allah yang Mahakuasa menjadi manusia, Sang Kebenaran itu sendiri, hadir menampilkan diri-Nya ke dalam sejarah manusia. Dia mendemonstrasikan kekuasaan Allah, memberitakan kebenaran dan menyatakan kebenaran dalam kehidupan-Nya yang kudus. Kristus bahkan berhadapan dengan Pontius Pilatus dan ia didapati tidak bersalah. Sampai akhir hidup-Nya diatas kayu salib, Ia tidak bersalah. Sama seperti Yohanes Pembaptis mati karena kebenaran, Kristus mati karena kebenaran. Bahkan melebihi itu semua, kematian-Nya membenarkan semua mereka yang percaya kepada-Nya, yang menjadikan diri mereka mati terhadap dosa-dosa atas dasar kematian Kristus dan Kristus menghidupkan mereka untuk hidup dalam kebenaran. Bahkan kebenaran itu tidak bisa dibungkam oleh kematian tetapi kebenaran itu telah mengalahkan kematian.
Kita yang percaya kepada-Nya, kita harus mengingat bahwa kita telah mati atas dosa-dosa kita dan hidup kita ini untuk kebenaran. Kita pun perlu mengingat bahwa seberapa besar pun resiko yang kita terima sebagai seorang pewarta kebenaran tidak sebanding dengan kebenaran Allah yang telah dianugerahkan-Nya kepada kita melalui Tuhan Yesus Kristus. Harapan bagi orang hidup dalam kebenaran dan Kristus adalah kehidupan yang tidak akan berakhir karena Kristus hidup di dalam kita untuk selamanya.

Satu Kekuranganmu
Markus 10:17-31

Jawaban Tuhan Yesus ini penting bagi kita karena Ia mengutip dari Firman Allah yaitu dari Kitab Keluaran 20, salah satu kitab di Perjanjian Lama. Tetapi yang menarik adalah Yesus menyebut bagian kedua dari 10 Perintah Allah itu lebih dahulu. Ini tentu ada hubungannya dengan sikap dari orang muda kaya itu terhadap kekayaannya. Apa yang ingin Yesus sampaikan?
Perlu disadari bersama bahwa bagian ini merupakan bagian dari konteks waktu Tuhan Yesus sudah mulai memberitahukan apa yang akan terjadi dengan diri-Nya. Dia sedang mengarahkan dan mempersiapkan diri-Nya untuk pergi ke Yerusalem untuk memberikan nyawa-Nya (‘segala sesuatu’) sebagai tebusan bagi banyak orang, tetapi pada hari yang ketiga Ia akan bangkit kembali. Tuhan Yesus siap memberikan nyawa-Nya menjadi tebusan bagi banyak orang.
Ketika ingin meneruskan perjalanan-Nya bersama dengan para murid-Nya, seorang pemuda yang kaya datang bersujud kepada-Nya. Sikap dari pemuda ini bukan sebuah sikap yang berlebihan karena ia ingin mendengarkan apa yang dikatakan Yesus kepadanya supaya ia beroleh hidup yang kekal. Dia menunjukkan sikap yang ingin belajar dan hormat kepada Tuhan Yesus. Sanjungan kepada Yesus dengan menyebut-Nya sebagai Guru yang baik, merupakan sapaan yang tidak biasa. Pemuda itu menyapa Yesus dengan Guru yang baik. Hal ini membuat Yesus bertanya apa maksud pemuda itu dengan mengatakan Ia baik? Tuhan Yesus ingin mengetahui motif hatinya dibalik sikapnya dan perkataannya tersebut kepada Tuhan Yesus.
Tuhan Yesus melanjutkan dengan sebuah jawaban yang diketahui oleh pemuda kaya tersebut (19). “Jangan membunuh, jangan berzinah, jangan mencuri, jangan mengucapkan saksi dusta, jangan mengurangi hak orang, hormatilah ayahmu dan ibumu!” Sebelum Tuhan Yesus melanjutkannya, pemuda kaya itu menanggapi jawaban tersebut dengan berkata :”Guru, semuanya itu telah kuturuti sejak masa mudaku.” Hal ini dia tegaskan bahwa dia layak mendapatkan hidup kekal karena dia sudah menjaga hidupnya sesuai dengan perintah Allah.
Tetapi jawaban Tuhan Yesus yang berikutnya mengejutkan dan membuat pemuda kaya itu pulang sambil bersedih. Markus memberikan catatan bahwa Tuhan Yesus memandang dan menaruh kasih kepada pemuda kaya itu. Ini menegaskan bahwa Tuhan Yesus memang mengetahui hatinya yang terikat dengan hal yang lain yaitu pada hartanya, bukan kepada Allah. Dia tahu bahwa jawaban-Nya itu akan membuat dirinya bersedih. Tuhan Yesus berkata “Hanya satu lagi kekuranganmu: pergilah, juallah apa yang kaumiliki dan berikanlah itu kepada orang-orang miskin, maka engkau akan beroleh harta di sorga, kemudian datanglah ke mari dan ikutlah Aku.” Tuhan Yesus meminta pemuda itu untuk menjual segala milik dan hartanya serta memberikan kepada orang miskin maka dia akan beroleh harta di Sorga kemudian menjadi pengikut Tuhan Yesus. Disinilah Tuhan Yesus memberikan tes kepadanya untuk melihat motif terdalam pemuda kaya tersebut. Disinilah kita akan melihat “Apakah ia mengasihi Allah atau hartanya?”
Motif hati kita terhadap harta kekayaan baru terungkap ketika kita menghadapi ujian ketika kita kehilangan harta kita. Motivasi kita yang terdalam terungkap apakah kita mengasihi Allah dengan segenap hati atau tidak ketika kita mengalami kehilangan harta duniawi. Ini mengingatkan saya sebuah doa dari seorang pendeta bernama Henri Nouwen yang berkata :”
“Dear God,
I am so afraid to open my clenched fists!
Who will I be when I have nothing left to hold on to?
Who will I be when I stand before you with empty hands?
Please help me to gradually open my hands
and to discover that I am not what I own,
but what you want to give me.”

Walaupun Tuhan Yesus sudah menawarkan harta Sorgawi dan meminta dia mengikut-Nya, yang dia hormati dan panggil sebagai guru yang baik, pemuda itu pulang dengan hati bersedih karena hatinya berpaut pada hartanya, bukan pada Tuhan. Jawaban Tuhan Yesus adalah jawaban yang mengarahkan hati pemuda kaya itu dan kita semua pada perintah yang pertama dan utama yaitu “Kasihilah Tuhan Allahmu dengan segenap hatimu dan dengan segenap jiwamu dan dengan segenap akal budimu”. Dengan reaksi yang ditunjukkan oleh pemuda kaya, yang meninggalkan Tuhan Yesus dan bersedih, menunjukkan bahwa ia telah gagal mentaati Perintah Allah yang utama. Dia pun menolak untuk mengikut Tuhan Yesus.
Inilah gambaran yang baik bagi kita semua bahwa keselamatan atau hidup yang kekal itu tidak diterima atas dasar perbuatan baik atau karena kita menuruti perintah-perintah Allah, yang pada kenyataannya tidak ada yang sanggup melakukan seluruhnya dengan sempurna.
Seorang pendeta anglikan bernama J.C Ryle berkata :
“Hati kita lemah. Dosa kita banyak. Kita membutuhkan Penebus yang mampu menyelamatkan sepenuhnya dan melepaskan dari murka yang akan datang. Kita memiliki Penebus seperti itu di dalam Yesus Kristus.”

Setelah pemuda kaya itu pergi Tuhan Yesus memandang para murid-Nya dan berkata “24…Anak-anak-Ku, alangkah sukarnya masuk ke dalam Kerajaan Allah. 25 Lebih mudah seekor unta melewati lobang jarum dari pada seorang kaya masuk ke dalam Kerajaan Allah.” Jelas apa yang digambarkan oleh Tuhan Yesus itu sesuatu yang mustahil. Jika pemuda yang sudah melalukan kebaikan dan kaya itu saja tidak dapat masuk ke dalam kerajaan Sorga lalu siapa yang sanggup? Para murid sadar bahwa mereka pun tidak lebih baik dari pemuda kaya itu. Kesadaran ini mendorong mereka bertanya bertanya “Jika demikian, siapakah yang dapat diselamatkan?”
Tuhan Yesus menyadari pertanyaan ketidaklayakan para murid-Nya dengan kembali memandang para murid-Nya dan berkata “Bagi manusia hal itu tidak mungkin, tetapi bukan demikian bagi Allah. Sebab segala sesuatu adalah mungkin bagi Allah.” Artinya bahwa Allah sendirilah sanggup mengubahkan hati manusia oleh kedaulatan dan anugerah-Nya untuk mengikut Kristus. Bukan atas dasar perbuatan baik manusia seseorang dapat diselamatkan tetapi melalui iman di dalam melalui pribadi dan karya Tuhan Yesus Kristus. Efesus 2:8-9 berkata “Sebab karena kasih karunia kamu diselamatkan oleh iman itu bukan hasil usahamu, tetapi pemberian Allah, itu bukan hasil pekerjaanmu; janga ada orang yang memegahkan diri”
Oleh karena tidak ada satu pun yang sanggup menyelamatkan dirinya sendiri maka Tuhan Yesus Kristus datang. Hanya Kristus yang mampu melakukan semua perintah Allah itu, mengasihi Allah dengan segenap hatimu, jiwamu dan kekuatanmu dan mengasihi sesamamu manusia seperti dirimu sendiri, melalui kehidupan, kematian dan kebangkitan-Nya dengan tanpa cacat cela. Ibrani 4:15 berkata “Sebab Imam Besar yang kita punya, bukanlah Imam besar yang tidak dapat turut merasakan kelemahan-kelemahan kita, sebaliknya sama dengan kita, Ia telah dicobai, hanya tidak berbuat dosa” di Padang gurun Tuhan Yesus dicobai. Dia ditawarkan seluruh kekayaan dunia ini akan diberikan kepada-Nya, asalkan Dia mau menyembah Iblis. Dia berkata : Ada pula tertulis : Janganlah engkau mencobai Tuhan, Allahmu!”. Tuhan Yesus dicobai tetapi tidak berdosa. Bukan hanya itu, pada ayat 45 kita melihat bagaimana Tuhan Yesus menjelaskan tujuan-Nya datang ke dunia ini adalah untuk melayani dan memberikan nyawa-Nya menjadi tebusan bagi banyak orang. Ini sebuah gambaran bagaimana keselamatan atau hidup yang kekal itu akan diberikan melalui kematian-Nya. Dia mati untuk dosa-dosa kita (1 Petrus 2:24) dan Dia mati ketika kita masih berdosa (Roma 5:8). Melalui kematian-Nya kita mati terhadap dosa-dosa kita. Maut telah ditelan oleh kematian Kristus. Melalui kebangkitan-Nya kita dihidupkan ( dalam hidup kekal) untuk kebenaran.
Setelah jawaban Tuhan Yesus, Petrus kemudian memecahkan suasana dengan berkata :”Kami telah meninggalkan segala sesuatu dan mengikut Engkau!”. Dengan mengatakan demikian Petrus sebenarnya mengingatkan Tuhan Yesus mengenai panggilan untuk mengikutiNya kepada Petrus, Andreas, Yakobus dan Yohanes dalam Markus 1:16-20. Ketika Tuhan Yesus memanggil mereka maka mereka meninggalkan apa yang mereka pegang ditangan mereka dan mengikuti Dia. Tetapi jika kita andaikan bila pemuda kaya itu datang dan mengikut Tuhan Yesus inilah jawaban yang Tuhan Yesus berikan kepada pemuda yang kaya itu jika ia mau menjual hartanya dan memberikan kepada orang miskin lalu datang dan mengikut Yesus. Jawab Yesus :”Aku berkata kepadamu, sesungguhnya setiap orang yang karena Aku dan karena Injil meninggalkan rumahnya, saudaranya laki-laki atau saudaranya perempuan, ibunya atau bapanya, anak-anaknya atau ladangnya, orang itu sekarang pada masa ini juga akan menerima kembali seratus kali lipat; rumah, saudara laki-laki, saudara perempuan, ibu, anak dan ladang, sekalipun disertai berbagai penganiayaan, dan pada zaman yang akan datang ia akan menerima hidup yang kekal” Kembali Yesus menekankan hal yang sama yaitu kepemilikan rohani.
Harta rohani termasuk di dalam hidup yang kekal dan keluarga atau persaudaraan dalam Kristus. Kita tidak menjalin hubungan dengan harta yang mati tetapi dengan pribadi-pribadi yang hidup dalam kerajaan Allah yaitu jemaat-Nya dan Kristus sendiri. Kita tidak dipanggil ke dalam sebuah hubungan hanya kita dan Tuhan kita. Istri saya selalu mengingatkan saya bahwa sekarang mamamu menjadi mama kita. Ayahku menjadi ayah kita. Kita seperti film Jim Carrey yang berjudul me, myself and Irene yang sama dengan me, myself and my Lord. Kita dipanggil ke dalam kerajaan Allah bersama saudara-saudara yang lain. Kita menjadi satu umat, satu keluarga, satu kesatuan untuk mengikuti Kristus. Lihatlah nama-nama di layar zoom anda sekarang mereka inilah yang akan bersama-sama dengan kita pada masa kini dan sampai selamanya di dalam kekekalan. Karena kita dipanggil ke dalam satu keluarga maka kristus memanggil kita untuk saling mengasihi melalui perkataan dan perbuatan kita. Lihat bagaimana jemaat mula-mula itu berkembang, mereka yang memiliki harta, rumah, tanah mereka menjualnya dan hasil penjualan harta itu diberikan di hadapan para rasul lalu para rasul membagi-bagikan kepada mereka yang membutuhkan di dalam jemaat. Oleh karena itu tidak ada yang kekurangan di tengah-tengah mereka. (Kisah para rasul 2:45; 4:34, 37). Apa yang Yesus katakan menjadi sebuah kenyataan kepemilikan rohani itu nyata ketika mereka masih ada di bumi dengan tindakan saling mengasihi dan menolong diantara jemaat mula-mula. Mereka mendapatkan saudara-saudara seiman yang mengasihi mereka dengan tulus.

Sekarang Dia sedang memandang hatimu dan wajah-Nya yang penuh belas kasihan itu sedang menunggumu untuk engkau menaruh imanmu kepada-Nya. Jangan taruh hati pada hartamu untuk mendapatkan hidup kekal, tetapi taruhlah hatimu dan hidupmu di dalam Tuhan Yesus Kristus. Ia telah memberikan nyawa-Nya menjadi tebusan bagi nyawamu. Dia memberikan hidup-Nya supaya engkau mendapat hidup yang kekal dan hidup bersama-sama dengan-Nya dan bersama jemaat-Nya sekarang dan sampai kekekalan.

No sorrow No sadness No Death in Him (Jesus Christ) only life and fellowship with His saints from everlasting to everlasting. Amen

Berbahagia Karena Allah
LUKAS 6:17-26


6:17 Lalu Ia turun dengan mereka dan berhenti pada suatu tempat yang datar: di situ berkumpul sejumlah besar dari murid-murid-Nya dan banyak orang lain yang datang dari seluruh Yudea dan dari Yerusalem dan dari daerah pantai Tirus dan Sidon. 6:18 Mereka datang untuk mendengarkan Dia dan untuk disembuhkan dari penyakit mereka; juga mereka yang dirasuk oleh roh-roh jahat beroleh kesembuhan. 6:19 Dan semua orang banyak itu berusaha menjamah Dia, karena ada kuasa yang keluar dari pada-Nya dan semua orang itu disembuhkan-Nya.
6:20 Lalu Yesus memandang murid-murid-Nya dan berkata:


A1 “Berbahagialah, hai kamu yang miskin, karena kamulah yang empunya Kerajaan Allah.
B1 6:21 Berbahagialah, hai kamu yang sekarang ini lapar, karena kamu akan dipuaskan. Berbahagialah, hai kamu yang sekarang ini menangis, karena kamu akan tertawa.
C1 6:22 Berbahagialah kamu, jika karena Anak Manusia orang membenci kamu, dan jika mereka mengucilkan kamu, dan mencela kamu serta menolak namamu sebagai sesuatu yang jahat.
6:23 Bersukacitalah pada waktu itu dan bergembiralah, sebab sesungguhnya, upahmu besar di sorga; karena secara demikian juga nenek moyang mereka telah memperlakukan para nabi.
A2 6:24 Tetapi celakalah kamu, hai kamu yang kaya, karena dalam kekayaanmu kamu telah memperoleh penghiburanmu.
B2 6:25 Celakalah kamu, yang sekarang ini kenyang, karena kamu akan lapar. Celakalah kamu, yang sekarang ini tertawa, karena kamu akan berdukacita dan menangis.
C2 6:26 Celakalah kamu, jika semua orang memuji kamu; karena secara demikian juga nenek moyang mereka telah memperlakukan nabi-nabi palsu.”

Menjadi orang yang bahagia adalah impian banyak orang. Kebahagiaan seringkali menjadi subjektif karena kondisi dan budaya untuk sebuah kebahagiaan dalam satu bangsa berbeda dengan bangsa lain. Ukuran kebahagiaan pun menjadi sangat beragam. Tetapi bukan berarti tidak ada ukurannya. Bahagia biasa secara umum dikaitkan dengan seberapa banyak kekayaan yang kita miliki. Karena dengan kekayaan kita bisa memiliki support hidup yang sehari-hari kita. Dengan kekayaan kita juga memiliki status sosial yang berbeda dengan orang lain. Kita akan bertemu dengan orang-orang penting dan diterima oleh banyak orang. Tetapi bagaimana bagi mereka yang miskin? Kita mungkin akan berkata mereka tidak bahagia jika ukurannya kekayaan. Mereka pun tidak akan mendapatkan kepuasaan atau kenyang karena tidak ada uang untuk membeli apa yang mereka inginkan.
Pesan Injil hari ini jelas bahwa orang yang disebut bahagia dalam Kristus bukanlah orang kaya tetapi orang yang miskin. Kita mungkin bertanya akhirnya lalu bagaimana dengan orang kaya? Apakah mereka bisa bahagia? Itu akan kita jawab dengan mulai melihat bagian kedua dari khotbah Yesus ini.

Khotbah ini diberikan kepada murid-murid-Nya setelah Yesus memilih murid-murid-Nya. Jika membaca pasal sebelumnya Yesus memanggil murid-murid-Nya untuk mengikut-Nya. Mengenai mereka Injil Lukas menuliskan bahwa mereka meninggalkan segala sesuatunya dan mengikut Yesus. Mereka meninggalkan kapal yang penuh ikan, ketika jala yang mereka pakai mulai robek dan kapalnya hampir tenggelam karena terlalu banyak ikan. Lewi atau Matius, pemungut cukai meninggalkan meja cukainya dan mengikut Yesus. Jadi mereka ini adalah orang-orang yang meninggalkan segala sesuatunya bagi mengikut Yesus. Pertanyaan bukan lah apakah mereka bahagia? Tetapi apa yang membuat mereka meninggalkan segala sesuatunya dan mengapa? Jawabannya sederhana karena mereka bahagia. Mengapa ini jawaban yang penting? Karena Yesus sendiri menyebut mereka adalah orang-orang yang berbahagia kepada para murid-Nya. Mereka yang telah meninggalkan segala sesuatunya itu adalah orang-orang berbahagia.

Mengapa berbahagia karena Yesus mengetahui hati para murid-Nya dan karena kebahagiaan mereka tidak lagi ditentukan oleh seberapa banyak yang mereka miliki. Tetapi karena mereka mengikuti pribadi yang melebihi dari segala sesuatu. Inilah mengapa Yesus mengatakan “berbahagialah kamu yang miskin, karena kamu empunya kerajaan Allah” Disini kita melihat sebuah bahasa kepemilikan, kita adalah pemilik kerajaan Allah. Kerajaan Allah yang adalah milik Allah sekarang kita dimasukkan ke dalam kepemilikan Allah itu. Kita memiliki lebih dari dunia ini tetapi kerajaan Allah. Itu bagian pertama kita melihat bagaimana Tuhan Yesus melihat kita dalam kerajaan Allah. Kita ada di dalam Kerajaan Allah dan kita memiliki lebih dari cukup.

Bagian kedua adalah mengenai kepuasaan. Jika kepuasaan itu dipenuhi maka kebahagiaan datang. Itu yang dipercaya oleh dunia kita. Tetapi kita melihat sebaliknya dalam perkataan Tuhan Yesus. Mereka yang lapar dan menangis akan dipuaskan dan tertawa. Bagian kedua ini, berbeda dengan bagian pertama, ada kata “sekarang ini”. Kata keterangan ini menekankan bahwa rasa lapar dan tangisan di zaman sekarang ini adalah sementara. Tuhan Yesus memberikan sebuah perspektif yang berbeda bahwa rasa lapar dan tangis tidak akan berlangsung selamanya. Ini juga menunjukkan sebuah bayangan janji kekal akan dunia dimana tidak akan tangis dan air mata.

Bagian ketiga adalah mengenai penerimaan. Orang yang kaya dan punya segala sesuatu akan diterima. Tetapi Tuhan Yesus mengatakan “berbahagialah jika karena Anak Manusia orang membenci kamu…mengucilkan kamu… dan menolak namamu sebagai sesuatu yang jahat” Orang yang dibenci karena imannya dalam Tuhan Yesus kristus atau karena mengikuti Tuhan Yesus adalah orang yang berbahagia. Mengapa karena kebahagiaannya tidak lagi terletak pada penerimaan manusia tetapi penerimaan Anak Manusia terhadap dirinya. Objek dari penerimaan atau pengakuan itu bukan lagi banyak orang tetapi hanya ditentukan oleh satu orang yaitu Tuhan Yesus Kristus. Penerimaan banyak orang bisa berubah, bahkan demokrasi pun bisa membuat orang dibenci karena dia tidak mengikuti suara mayoritas. Tetapi penilaian dan penerimaan Kristus tidak akan pernah berubah terhadap anak-anak-Nya. Karena itulah orang-orang yang menjadikan Yesus pusat penerimaannya adalah orang-orang yang berbahagia.

Bagian keempat adalah bagian sangat penting karena pada bagian ini, Tuhan Yesus menyebutkan dua kata perintah yang menekankan apa yang sudah dibicarakan sebelumnya. Jika di ayat 20, 21 dan 22 kata berbahagia sudah disebutkan secara intensif maka sekarang di ayat 23 ini Tuhan Yesus menyerukan kepada orang-orang yang berbahagia itu untuk bersukacita dan bergembira. Kata bersukacita dan bergembira dalam bahasa Indonesia mungkin tidak kelihatan ada perbedaan yang signifikan. Tetapi jika kita membaca kata Yunaninya maka kata “bergembira” itu, yang disampaikan setelah kata “bersukacitalah, itu digambarkan meloncat dengan girang” Ini merupakan alusi ke kisah Yohanes Pembaptis yang melonjak di dalam kandungan ibunya ketika mendengar Salam Maria (Lukas 1:41:44). Itu juga seperti Daud yang menari meloncat-loncat ketika Tabut Allah dipindahkan ke Yerusalem. Juga seperti yang dinubuatkan dalam Yesaya 35:1-10. Nubuatan mengenai kedatangan Mesias yang akan menyelamatkan dan membebaskan dan memberikan kegirangan kepada orang lemah lesu, orang buta dicelikan, telinga orang tuli dibuka dan orang lumput akan melompat seperti rusa, dan mulut orang bisa bersorak-sorai, dan dari padang gurun memancar mata air serta sungai di padang belantara. Mengapa kata itu begitu dipenuhi dengan gambaran kegembiran yang besar? Karena Allah berjalan di tengah-tengah manusia dan Ia menjadi penyelamat mereka.

Lalu bagaimana dengan orang kaya tadi? Apakah orang kaya tidak bisa bahagia seperti itu? Jawaban ya bisa. Karena Lukas menggambarkan orang kaya disini sebagai kelompok orang yang bukan hanya memiliki kekayaan tetapi mereka menahan apa yang mereka miliki bagi diri mereka sendiri. Kata kaya di ayat 24 itu memiliki arti memiliki banyak, kata ini antitesis dengan kata “empunya kerajaan Allah” Lukas tidak memakai kata kaya kepada mereka yang berbahagia, tetapi dia menunjukkan langsung bahwa orang yang berbahagia karena mengikut Kristus adalah mereka yang sudah memiliki Kerajaan Allah dengan segala kemuliaan-Nya. Kata kaya disini juga identik dengan menahan kekayaannya untuk dirinya sendiri. Dirinya dihiburkan oleh kekayaannya itu, jadi kekayaan itu digunakan untuk dirinya sendiri. Mereka ini adalah orang-orang yang tidak mau berbagi dengan orang lain.
Inipun sama dengan kepuasaan. Sekali lagi Tuhan Yesus menekankan kata “sekarang ini”. Dia katakan “Celakalah kamu, yang sekarang ini kenyang, karena kamu akan lapar. Celakalah kamu, yang sekarang ini tertawa, karena kamu akan berdukacita dan menangis.” Bahwa kepuasaanmu, rasa kenyang dan tawa itu sementara ketika seseorang memusatkan dirinya kepada kepuasaan yang sementara dan tidak kekal. Mereka adalah orang yang tidak mau berbagi roti dan ikan dengan orang lain yang kelaparan dan penghiburan kepada mereka yang menangis.

Bagian terakhir pun memiliki nada yang sama, inilah orang-orang yang mencari penerimaan dirinya atas pujian dari banyak orang. Bagian ini dihubungkan dengan nabi-nabi palsu. Nabi-nabi palsu ini memiliki karakter yang sama yaitu mereka hanya ingin dipuji oleh manusia dan bukan mau menyampaikan Firman Allah yang benar dan mungkin dibenci banyak orang, karena kebenaranya. Kepada orang-orang seperti itulah Tuhan Yesus memperingatkan bahwa mereka berada dalam penghakiman Allah dan tidak akan bisa berbahagia.

Sekarang lihat apa Tuhan Yesus lakukan sebelum dia menyampaikan khotbah ini. Dia bukan hanya mengajar tetapi juga menggunakan kuasanya untuk melayani dan menyembuhkan banyak orang yang mengalami kelemahan atau sakit penyakit. Dia turun membagi-bagikan “pemberian-pemberian” yang baik kepada mereka yang membutuhkan. Mengapa karena Dialah Sang Mesias itu sendiri, Allah yang turun dan datang untuk menyelamatkan manusia. Dialah pusat dan sumber kebahagiaan sejati semua manusia. Dia memberikan kegirangan kekal kepada jiwa manusia baik orang miskin dan kaya. Yang membuat orang miskin tidak mengandalkan kekayaan sebagai sumber kebahagiaannya dan orang kaya tidak menahan kekayaannya untuk dirinya sendiri.

Kita melihat orang-orang yang berbahagia ini bertindak sesuai dengan identitasnya dalam Kristus dengan melihat bagaimana orang Israel harus membebaskan orang berhutang kepadanya dan melepas kembali tanah milik saudaranya pada tahun Yobel dan pada kisah jemaat mula-mula yang melayani orang-orang miskin, orang kaya menjual hartanya dan membagi-bagikannya kepada mereka yang membutuhkan sehingga tidak ada lagi yang kekurangan. Inilah komunitas yang dimaksudkan Tuhan Yesus orang yang berbahagia dalam Kristus.

Love Bade Me Welcome
“Love bade me welcome…”
—George Herbert
“Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God. And that is what we are!” —St. John the Apostle

I once spoke at a retreat in the Poconos. The menu was bizarre to a degree that became legendary among the participants, but the scenery was nice, and two young men professed faith in Christ during the weekend. Ever curious about what God uses to move different individuals, I asked one of them what had been faith’s tipping point. It had been the idea that God loved him.

God’s love has wonderstruck many, and for some it becomes a lifelong source of amazement. That was true for the one known to history as “the beloved disciple,” St. John. Late in his own spiritual journey the wonder was still with him as he wrote these words that have been dancing in my own imagination of late:

“Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God. And that is what we are!” 1 John 3:1

Back when words seemed to matter more than they do now, bible teachers would look a word up, pull it apart, and squeeze it until the essential oils oozed out. I fell back to that old habit and looked up the etymology of the word behold. I was curious because modern translations tend to begin 1John 3:1: with see rather than behold, as in, “See the love the Father has given to us…” It works well enough, but behold was too plump and ripe not to be squeezed. It is made up of two parts. The be- was originally spelled bi- and meant “thoroughly” (think of bisect). Then the second part, hold derived from halden, a word that meant, surprise, ‘hold’. Only English, out of the various Germanic languages, welded those two bits together to express the idea of looking. It is used in our passage, not of literal sight, but of figuratively ‘giving regard to’ God’s love, or ‘keeping it in view’.

Maybe this word retired too early, then. Thoroughly hold, grasp, latch onto this manner in which God loves us: he calls us his children. He calls us his own, claims us. It makes sense then, since he calls us his children, that the quintessential prayer of the Christian religion begins, “Our Father…” and that our most essential church furniture includes a family table at which our Father is always present, and around which we arrange ourselves to eat and to drink, to listen and to speak, to ask Father for what we need.
Conversation around that table may be formal, but it is not a formality, let alone formalism. True, we don’t address our Father as we would speak with our chums, but that doesn’t make the conversation cold or distant. We tell and hear family stories around the supper table where all the siblings are gathered, and nurtured, and encouraged.

Too many families these days are missing a table, or missing at table, for the busyness of modern life flings us in different directions on different schedules. And, in some churches have we not noticed that under the impulse of rejecting “formalism,” the forms and the furniture of God’s family have gone missing as well? There is no table, or it is dragged out infrequently, to keep it “special” we are told, but I can hardly imagine my earthly father hiding the table in his country home for most of the month, gathering us there only once in a great while, after many lectures, for a “special” meal. Even when we are not using the table it is always there with its memories of a thousand meals and ten thousand stories. There is, of course, one memory that stands out above all others at the Lord’s Table, and like the story of an older brother who died in the service, that story is bittersweet.
It recalls an older brother who went out at the Father’s urging to bring us home from our far-flung wanderings and captivities and into his presence. But there was a supreme sacrifice involved in reseating us at the table from which we were one and all alienated. That sacrifice is what amazes St. John, or rather, it is that sacrifice as balanced against the reason why it was needed. And so we must behold the bad news that brought forth the good. The Hebrew world had humanity in halves. One half we may call, ‘God’s people’, and the other half we may call the Gentiles, but there was enough bad news for everyone. By his prophet Hosea God told his people Israel that by the vilest unfaithfulness they had forfeited their position in God’s family. Name your son, “Not my people,” he told Hosea, “for you are not my people and I am not your God.”
The Gentiles were already alienated. St. Paul later described them as, “…separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.” And yet, God had promised to bless all the nations through Abraham’s offspring. How? And Hosea’s prophecy had not ended with that final-sounding judgment upon Israel. But remembering his promises to Abraham about them, God had concluded that in the very place where they were “not his people,” they would somehow, someday, be called “children of the living God.” Herein is the incongruity of the good news, that for those who were not only undeserving, but ill-deserving, and while they “were yet sinners, Christ died for the ungodly.”

God our Father took the rulebook according to which Jew and Gentile alike stood outside, disqualified, disowned, and nailed it to the cross through the hands of our older Brother Jesus. Into one hand was nailed, “Hear o Israel, the Lord is One, and you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart… “. Into the other hand was nailed, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” And the blood of Israel’s truest son, Jesus, as it trickled down across the penalty of death that went with each broken law, spelled out these words, “Paid in full.”

The cross, then, is not a lucky decoration for dame or dashboard, much less the emblem of imperial pride or anti-Semitism. It is an invitation that says, “My children, I love you and stand ready to forgive you; turn round, and come home. Your place is set; your debt is paid; your journey is covered; return. This love that stuck St. John with wonder, and that drew my not so saintly young retreaters right around the Father’s table sent the poet George Herbert to his pen and paper to record what he beheld, and where it held him.

“Love bade me welcome. Yet my soul drew back
Guilty of dust and sin.
But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack
From my first entrance in,
Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning,
If I lacked any thing.

A guest, I answered, worthy to be here:
Love said, You shall be he.
I the unkind, ungrateful? Ah my dear,
I cannot look on thee.
Love took my hand, and smiling did reply,
Who made the eyes but I?

Truth Lord, but I have marred them: let my shame
Go where it doth deserve.
And know you not, says Love, who bore the blame?
My dear, then I will serve.
You must sit down, says Love, and taste my meat:
So I did sit and eat.”

“Behold what manner of love the Father has given unto us…”
That Love bids you welcome, for “in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ. Behold this unbalanced love, and come home! +

On the Resurrection
“Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, they may forget, yet I will not forget you. Behold, I have carved you on the palms of my hands. (Is.49:15-16)”

When I was a boy, it was our custom to carve the initials of our current crushes along with our own on trees. If you’re not afraid of a little climbing, you can still find J.L. & L.D., with a heart around the letters, and an arrow through the heart carved on my favorite beech tree. (L.D. never knew about it, but it’s there.) Scholars tell us that in biblical times, if you loved someone very much, you might tattoo their name, or “carve” it on the palms of your hands. This was a sign of devotion and a close reminder of your love, much like a wedding ring is today.

The Bible pictures God’s relationship with his people as a marriage. God is the groom, and Israel his bride. In the days of Isaiah, though, Israel had come to feel like an abandoned lover. Where were the phone calls, the flowers, the concern? “The LORD has forsaken me, the LORD has forgotten me,” became their mantra. Mother Theresa once said that if you find yourself far from God, he’s not the one who has moved, and that was the case with Israel. It had been their own decision to drift from their Husband’s house. The bride had been unfaithful, which makes God’s response all the more meaningful: Forget you? Forsake you? Can a mother forget her nursing child? Can a woman lack compassion for the child of her own body? I don’t think so, but even if they should forget, I will not forget you. “Look here!” God says, “I have carved you on the palms of my hands.” This is stereo, not just one, but both hands are marked.
What the Hebrew prophet prints in black and white, the New Testament paints in living color — it is like looking up from a shadow to the one who cast it. When Isaiah speaks of scars on God’s palms, whose thoughts can help but run ahead to Jesus? Where else are Isaiah’s words so plainly fulfilled and God’s commitment so clearly shown? Messiah’s hands were quite literally “tattooed” for us—not with needles, but with Roman spikes. “The scars in his hands, they tell me how much he loves me.” Jesus never hides those hands in his pockets, and scars don’t slide off like wedding rings. He will never forsake his chosen bride, and no one can pluck her out of his hands. When people, and circumstances, and our own sins knock us down so far that we feel forsaken, God’s promises and his palms correct us.
Remember how they corrected “doubting” Thomas ? After the crucifixion, Thomas doubted Jesus. The “way, the truth, and the life” had died, and death is the ultimate forgetfulness: the final forsaking. Thomas’s first look at the cross showed him only the vacancy of death. It’s nail holes seemed as empty as Jesus’ promises. The discovery of his friends did not move him an inch. “We’ve seen the Lord,” they told him. Thomas shot back, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.” A week later, Jesus surprised the disciples again, and this time Thomas was in the fellowship, doubts and all. “Put your finger here; see my hands. . ., said Jesus, . . .stop doubting, and believe.”
Have you ever looked at the altar cross and wondered what the letters “IHS” meant? The letters are not English or even Latin. They are Jesus’ initials in Greek. The prophet Isaiah also speaks of one who would be pierced for the sins of his people. The synagogue skips that section of his prophecy, but we dare not, for it teaches, as St. Anselm would later clarify, that when he died on the cross Christ’s hands and feet and side were pierced where ours should have been pierced. The initials on the cross that should have been yours, are HIS. He died in our place, defeated death, and ascended to heaven carrying the nailprints. His initials are on the cross, but yours are in his palms because he will not forget you.
Jesus is holding his hand out at this moment, through his word. If you put your hand in his, you will feel the evidence of his devotion – – – it is engraved in the nail prints. If you hold on tightly, you can feel your initials tattooed there in the Braille of love. Old English called the cross the “rood” which means the tree. Into that “tree” of Mount Calvary, the Messiah’s initials were carved in your spot, not by his hands, but through them. They are etched with iron, and highlighted red with his blood. He will never leave you; he will never forsake you.
Listen one last time to the word of the Lord: Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you! See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.

The Best-Laid Plans of Mice and Men
And let the net that he hid ensnare him;
let him fall into it—to his destruction! —Psalm 35:8

The temple priests of Jerusalem lived out these verses. They set a trap—that backfired. They asked the Roman governor for a kind of police line around Christ’s grave. “Sir,” they said, “we remember that while He was alive that deceiver said ‘After three days I will rise again.’ So give the order that the tomb be secured until the third day. “You have a guard, he said, go and make it as secure as you know how.”’ A Roman “guard” was a group of sixteen soldiers. According to biblical scholar Don Stewart, if a single one slept, they would all be executed. The priests then sealed the stone, set the guard, and satisfied themselves that all was secure, case closed, but the thoroughness of their arrangements meant there would be sixteen unbiased witnesses to what happened next. On the third day, with sixteen guards standing six feet apart, wide awake and well-armed,

“…there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men…”

To go to Pilate meant death, so the guards went to the priests, who paid them off to prevaricate, and promised to pay Pilate too if the matter came to his ears, but how could they escape the situation in which they found themselves intellectually? Their own guards had borne testimony of a divine event and messenger. Many of the priests belonged to a sect of Judaism that categorically denied life after death and also the existence of angels, so the testimony of the guards was doubly difficult to swallow. Their carefully constructed world was collapsing from the inside out, but they stubbornly held their ground for just a little longer.
This information in Matthew’s Gospel helps to explains an otherwise curious verse that the writer of Acts just drops off and leaves sans elaboration. Jesus is back in heaven. The apostles are preaching, praying, doing miracles, and arranging for the needs of the poor. At that time, says Acts, “…a great number of the priests became obedient to the faith.” Now, these are the Jewish priests. Their most prominent men had framed Jesus out of jealousy, out of confusion, out of pride, but in a kind of poetic justice, they, more than most, were stuck knowing the whole story. Having deceived others, they were forced, at last, to be honest with themselves, as must we all. They were caught in their own trap, but in the mercy of their God they were not destroyed. They believed and were forgiven, as Jesus had prayed they would be. The best laid plans of mice and men sometimes run amok, but providence never does, and that, my friends, is good news, nicht wahr? + Amen.

Sorrow (and Snowflakes)
Martha and Mary asked Jesus for help when their brother was deathly ill. When Jesus arrived too late to do any good (so they thought) they each vented with identical words. Each one says, “Lord, if you had been here my brother would still be alive.” Neither said, “our” brother? Why not?
“Each heart knows its own bitterness,” says the old Jewish Proverb…,” and how true that always is. Even for sisters who have lost the same brother the sorrow is never identical. Sorrows, like snowflakes are every one unique and unique to every one.

How do you view God?
In Leviticus 19 God tells us to be like him: “Be holy for the LORD your God is holy.” In 1 St. John 3:2, not what we are, but what we shall be is also described as a likeness to the Lord: “Beloved, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.” A.W. Tozer was perhaps right then in emphasizing the importance of how we see and understand God. He said:
“What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.

The history of mankind will probably show that no people has ever risen above its religion, and man’s spiritual history will positively demonstrate that no religion has ever been greater than its idea of God. Worship is pure or base as the worshiper entertains high or low thoughts of God.

For this reason the gravest question before the Church is always God Himself, and the most portentous fact about any man is not what he at a given time may say or do, but what he in his deep heart conceives God to be like.

We tend by a secret law of the soul to move toward our mental image of God. This is true not only of the individual Christian, but of the company of Christians that composes the Church. Always the most revealing thing about the Church is her idea of God.”

—A.W. Tozer, The Knowledge of the Holy (New York: HarperCollins, 1978), 1.

The psalmist understood all this long before any of us. His quintessential prayer request was: “One thing have I asked of the Lord, this will I earnestly seek: that I should dwell in the house of the Lord, all the days of my life, that I should behold the fair beauty of the Lord, and survey his temple.” What he requests God has given those who are living stones in his temple.

Why Plant Churches?
Why Plant Churches? A Paragraph from The Rev. Dr. Timothy Keller:

“Virtually all of the great evangelistic challenges of the New Testament are basically calls to plant churches, not simply to share the faith…. Studies have confirmed that the average new church gains most of its new members (60–80%) from the ranks of people who are not attending any worshiping body, while churches over ten to fifteen years of age gain 80–90 percent of new members by transfer from other congregations. This means the average new congregation will bring six to eight times more new people into the life of the body of Christ than an older congregation of the same size.”2

You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart
A local businessman returned from the World Economic Forum to share that WEF is showing increasing interest in the spiritual side of things. Around 84% of the world has some sort of faith, and one of the key WEF leaders, a secular European, admitted that apart from faith there is no firm intellectual basis for morality. He has just caught up with C.S. Lewis, who so many years ago wrote that a person lacking faith in God is trapped “…in a tiny windowless universe. Having only this world they have no counter-reality from which to judge it, no Archimedean point of leverage from which to reform it, and no heaven to relativize Hitler or any other horror.” A myriad of religions may have made a myriad of messes, but if there is no God, then all things are ultimately permissible, and this simply cannot be. If this simply cannot be, then let’s open the windows again for some fresh air and a new perspective. “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” Shakespeare is fine, but there is one main thing that puts all these other things in perspective, and the Hebrew prophet tells us this thing is a person. Here is his invitation to a generation behind shutters: “You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.”

When the Blessed Virgin Mary was first called “blessed” it was by an angel of the Lord. Having been informed that she would bear a son, she questioned how this could happen without a man’s involvement, for certainly no man had been involved with her in a way that could result in a son being born. St. Luke tells us what happened next:

And the angel answering said to her, `The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you, therefore also the holy-begotten thing shall be called Son of God;
and lo, Elisabeth, your kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her who was called barren;
because nothing shall be impossible with God.’

The lack of a man is no problem here, for God is doing a work like that of Creation when the Spirit hovered over the globe and made Adam without a man or a woman to help. When Luke gives Christ’s genealogy he draws Creation close to Redemption, calling Adam “the son of God.” Son of God Adam, like the Son of God, Jesus, had no human father, but that was never a problem for Father God. With God, nothing shall be impossible, not a virgin birth, or an elderly cousin in season out of time. It’s too early for Mary, too late for Elizabeth, but just on time for heaven.
“Nothing shall be impossible with God,” said Gabriel to Mary, and I suspect a couple of stories came to her memory as he spoke. The first is the story of Babel where men attempted the impossible on their own, apart from God —a tower into the heavens that would make its builders a name, and keep them together in one place contrary to divine instructions.
“The LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which mortals had built. And the LORD said, “Look, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. 7 Come, let us go down, and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.” 8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.”
Opposed to God, man found the imaginable yet impossible. Man relying upon man, mortal upon mere mortal aligned in opposition to God’s word—he had told them to spread out—failed miserably. Their project was never finished, and nothing is worse for a builder’s name than the remainder of an unfinished project lingering in public sight. Mankind united without God is impotent.
With God, though, and in line with his word, nothing shall be called impossible. When the angel spoke to Mary he used this word impossible that must certainly have reminded her of another old story, that of Sarah’s visit by the “three men” who said she would bear a child in her old age to the ancient Abraham her husband. Sarah was quite elderly too, and had been unsuccessful even in her youth at having babies. She laughed at the idea, now, and the Lord demanded to know why. “Is anything,” he asked, “too wonderful for the LORD?”
The angel’s explanation to Mary was that very question stated positively: “Nothing shall be impossible with God.” Elderly, barren Elizabeth’s miracle is an echo of Sarah’s and serves to light up the connection in case we’ve missed it between Genesis and Luke. Without God even possible things prove elusive, as at Babel, but with him not even the impossible is too wonderful. A virgin and her elderly cousin conceive, one without a man, and one with. And the virgin’s name is “blessed” and “favored.” She obtained by faith and without effort the name-fame so sought by the tower builders. Mary was obedient as the Lord’s humble “handmaiden” and became famous as Eve was infamous. Nobody knows the name of the most glamorous girl in Rome’s sprawling empire in the year of the Virgin’s conception. The wealthiest, wisest, and most sought after dames of that day are long since forgotten, but we know Mary’s name. “Blessed is she among women and blessed is the fruit of her womb… and blessed is she who believed what God had spoken.” By faith she succeeded where the first mother of man first failed. God “really had said,” to Eve and to Mary, but only Mary had really believed, and the many have become one again via her obedience and are set upon the stairway to heaven. That stairway is now complete, for as Jesus repeats in Luke 18:27, “what is impossible with men is possible with God.” The way of salvation is now finished. the ladder reaches the heavens. The author of Luke’s Gospel, let us remember, also wrote the the Book of Acts with the wonder of Pentecost where Babel unraveled for those in one place on God’s orders to keep a holy day and await the Holy Ghost.
To as many as received the Virgin’s son, God gave power to become the sons of God, born not of a husband’s will, but born of God. And how is the son of Mary and the Son of God received today? Just as Mary received him first, by believing that what was spoken by the Lord would be fulfilled, as it shall be, for nothing is too wonderful for the Lord, not Isaac in Sarah, or John in Elizabeth, or Christ in Mary, or in us. +Amen.

Shout to the LORD All You Lands…
The hugely popular song Hallelujah contains words and images which many must find confusing, beginning with the title itself. Its lyrics splice imagery from the tragic stumbles of King David and Samson together with a modern man’s frustrations with the woman who has drawn him into a trap where he feels confused, betrayed, and angry. At the same time it is a song that worships, or seeks to worship out of the brokenness of (the author’s?) relationship with his own personal Delilah. The songwriter’s last name is Cohen, which in Hebrew means priest, which perhaps adds a deeper irony to the song’s loose employment of scriptural imagery and the effectiveness of that imagery to strike a chord with the vaguely religious past of Cohen’s audience. The song is a scream of pain in the form of an argument in which the singer spits accusations at, and rehashes accusations from his lover. She doesn’t care for music, he fairly hisses, and we discover next that the music she (or perhaps we?) finds particularly objectionable is the chorus of the song being sung. She doesn’t like his broken Hallelujah.
“You say I took the name in vain
I don’t even know the name
But if I did, well really, what’s it to you?”
Most of the world, if they are thinking and not just tapping their toes, must at this point ask, “What name is he abusing?” Its the covenant name of God, which is hidden in the word hallelujah, which is Hebrew for “Praise the L_RD.” The final “J”and “h” in hallelujah, are the abbreviation of the holiest holy word in Judaism. “J” and “H” are the first two letters of what scholars call the Tetragrammaton, the four consonant name of God revealed at the burning bush to Moses. In English, hallelujah could be loosely translated, “Praise the I AM.” Orthodox Jews won’t even pronounce the Name hidden in Hallelujah for fear of misusing it, or, in the old language Cohen employs, “taking it in vain.” Strange then, that Cohen, as one descended from the priestly line, should sing that he doesn’t know the Name. It is all around an intriguing and a haunting song, but I use it here as a winding but not careless introduction to Psalm 100.
Psalm 100 was written by one who knew the Name, and like the word hallelujah it also hides the name, but I propose to show you where and to tell you why it matters. What’s it to you? Plenty. Psalm 100 is one of the most memorized Psalms of my generation. It is often the call to worship in Evangelical churches. It is mined for phrases in contemporary music, and is enshrined in the old prayer book as the second response to the second reading of Morning Prayer.
Anyone who has lived near a railroad can tell you though, that the more often you hear something, the less you really do hear it. It was as the second of two Psalms assigned for the morning office on Epiphany this year that I suddenly, after all these times, heard it well enough to feel its irony: At the heart of Israel’s parochial hymnbook is this universal call to worship “the Name”:
“O be joyful in the LORD, all ye lands…”
LORD spelt in capitals translates the covenant name of God, the Name revealed to Moses at the burning bush, and the Name the author of Hallelujah is accused of taking in vain. Psalm 100 is calling all the ethnicities, all the nations, all the lands of earth to be joyful in the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He continues, “Serve the LORD with gladness, and come before his presence with a song.” To serve means to worship—think of “worship service”— and notice where this worship is to locate itself: “before his presence.”
This is religious code. The “presence” of God is at the temple, specifically between the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant. This call to worship is a bold, bold summons that knows nothing of pluralistic compromise or of many paths leading to the same place. The nations are called to worship Israel’s covenant God by his special name, at his holy place, in his manifest presence!
The next verse gives us the rationale for this audacious invitation: “Be ye sure that the LORD he is God.” In Exodus 20 he is the LORD Israel’s God by dint of having delivered her from Egypt, but Psalm 100 claims the nations for worship by appeal to a more fundamental event. It draws upon the capital of creation. If the rationale of Israel’s obligation to obey the Ten Commandments was that only Adonai had made them a nation, the rationale of Psalm 100 is that only Adonai had formed the people who form the nations. “It is he who has made us, and not we ourselves.” They can only say “we are” because of the one who said, “I AM.” Come and worship, not the god of thunder or of fertility, or of the sun, but the God of all creation, the unmade Maker of us all.
Now here is where it gets downright interesting, for the Psalmist virtually erases the line between the categories of “who are we and who are they.” Still addressing all the nations, he says, including those nations, “we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.” Well, this being the case that they belong to God by dint of creation, and are his sheep, and are instructed to worship him, where else should they respond but the place having gates and courts, the already identified place of his presence. We pause here to recall that Jesus cleansed the temple once of money changers who were defiling the court of the Gentiles. He did so with a cord in his hands and a scripture on his lips: “My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.”
Thus the Psalm is no anomalous interruption of Scripture, but harmony with the melody sung marching to Zion, two parts of one song. Let the house of Israel now sing, and let the house of the nations sing too, “O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise; be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.” What is that name? Not, again, the generic terminology for a god or gods, but the specific, the matchless, the hallowed Name of four consonants in Hebrew, or four capitals in English, the LORD, Adonai himself.
This Psalm was sung mainly in one part until Jesus set in motion its fulfillment with another audacious declaration of the prerogatives of the God of Israel: “Make disciples of all nations…” In another place he said, “I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.” Yes, and Amen, and no wonder the prophet said that in the Messiah’s name the Gentiles would set their trust, say their prayers.
There is no temple of stone on Mt. Zion, but there is yet a place where his presence dwells, not a building, but a people, grafted into Israel to worship Israel’s God.
Let the nations worship him, serve him, sing joyfully from his liturgy in his temple because, “the LORD is gracious, his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endures from generation to generation.” O shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth, and sing, not in vain, but in true praise of the Name of your Maker:
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu—jah. +Amen.

Hope SNC visits PAC
Special Needs Sunday with Hope School and Sola Fide’s School of Tomorrow, two of our favorite institutions. God is good.

I once asked Ibu Lingkan about governmental schools for special needs kids. Her response was to point out a more special “need,” the students and clients have, namely the need for Jesus. You can only get his love from someone who has it, and friends, these teachers have it. In the years I’ve helped out at Hope and Sola Fide I’ve seen a steady stream of love poured out with the therapy and the teaching. Pray for these schools and others like them, and pray about contributing to their support. They are doing God’s work, and you can be part of it.

Do you pray?
“Your views of doctrine may be correct, your love of Protestantism may be warm and unmistakable but still this may be nothing more than head knowledge and party spirit. We want to know whether … you can speak to God as well as about God. Do you pray?” —from A Call to Prayer by Bishop J.C. Ryle

Bishop Ryle is really exploring what true faith looks like, which he does with a comment and a question. He comments that one’s love of “Protestantism,” —and here you may substitute Catholicism, Anglicanism, Pentecostalism, Fundamentalism, et cetera — may be as shallow and insignificant as one’s loyalty to a football club. You may support your denomination for the kinds of reasons you support Manchester; you may know the catechism like fans know the scorecard, but that doesn’t equal a relationship with God. For that matter, not all fans are good sportsmen and there is a certain similarity between the destructive banter of some (insert your denomination) “Christians” and British football hooligans. The glazed visage and flaring nostrils are the first clue. The irony of unsportsmanlike and unchristian behavior among those most vociferously committed to sport or religion makes a certain sense if I catch the good Bishop’s drift: in both cases we’re dealing with fans, not players. Ryle took a Blue in cricket at Oxford. He was a player par excellence, and he discerned that on the Christian pitch the ones praying are the ones playing. Thus, he asks whether you speak TO God or only ABOUT God. There is a difference between those who merely talk theology, and those who also pray. It is one thing to talk about Lionel Messi, but quite another to speak with him. Let’s ask ourselves, then, whether our religion is a matter of head knowledge and party spirit only? That makes hooligans but not disciples (Mt. 23:15)? The Bishop’s question is worth considering. Is our religion merely head knowledge and party spirit, or do we pray? +

The Giving Tree
The Giving Tree is the story of a tree that loves a boy, giving him its apples to sell for toys, its limbs to build his home, and finally its trunk to build a sailboat. By then the tree is just a stump with nothing left to offer but a place for the boy, who is now an old man, to sit. There is something sad about a stump, something depressing and disconcerting and incomplete. This is the situation the royal house of Israel occupies at the time of Christ. The family tree that had seemed so mighty in the days of David and Solomon had been “cut down to size” by its enemies. A mere stump now, it provided a seat, not for its rightful heir, but for the Romans and their puppets. Its glory had departed, or so it seemed, but there were strange prophecies about just such a time, just such a season and circumstance, as if God had anticipated the whole crisis and had a plan to bring it round right. A branch, said the Scriptures, would sprout out of the stump of Jesse, the ancestor of the Judean kings. Jesus was the branch that sprouted, not where branches belong, but from the stump. There was hope for the house of Judah, hope for God’s people Israel, and strangest of all, hope for the nations. The Apostle Paul points this out in Romans 15. Jewish Christians seem to have found his interest in the Gentiles strange. What interest did they have in Israel’s Messiah? Why was Paul, the Jew of all Jews so intent on reaching out to them, including them, emphasizing them?

His response is to quote verse after Jewish verse about the inclusion of the Gentiles:
“As it is written, “Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.” [10] And again it is said, “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people.” [11] And again, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples extol him.” [12] And again Isaiah says, “The root of Jesse will come, even he who arises to rule the Gentiles; in him will the Gentiles hope.” ”

Now what we have here is really quite remarkable. Among all the nations Israel is special in that they alone have been given God’s instructions. Among all Israel’s tribes Judah is special. Among all Judah’s families, one family is special, family of Jesse. Among all the sons of Jesse, David is chosen king. From him will come one favored above all, but this narrowing exclusivity serves an ultimate inclusivity by divine design. The favored son of a favored family of a favored tribe of a favored nation fulfills Israel’s scripture and yet, the purpose of this exclusive favor is to bring hope to all the earth, and every ethnicity.
From the stump of Jesse springs a righteous branch whose sap will heal the nations.

1 Lo, how a Rose e’er blooming
From tender stem hath sprung!
Of Jesse’s lineage coming
As men of old have sung.
It came, a flower bright,
Amid the cold of winter
When half-gone was the night.

“Let it be the real I that prays…”
“Let it be the real I that prays,
Let it be the real You to whom I pray.”

When Augustine first heard Bishop Ambrose preach he became aware that much of what he opposed in Christian theology was not, in point of fact, taught in Christian theology. He hadn’t known what he thought he’d known, and he carried a chastened humility to his eventual baptism, ordination, and elevation. The Augustine who wrote the prayer above saw that even after conversion one is liable to get God wrong, but notice his double-edged humility. Not only is there a danger of praying to a caricature of God (idolatry), but there’s an equal danger of getting ourselves wrong! Augustine is asking the Omniscient to help the doubly ignorant to dodge idolatry on the one end, and hypocrisy on the other. “Let it be the real I that prays, Let it be the real You to whom I pray. + Amen.

Getting Round to the True Meaning of Christmas
A long time ago, in a land far, far away lived a man grown so poor that he couldn’t feed his family. Worse yet, he had three daughters and no money for their dowries. In those days, and in that land, no dowry meant no marriage. And if they could not marry, they would be sold as slaves or something worse. One night the oldest daughter washed her stockings and hung them over the hearth embers to dry. When she went to fetch them next morning she noticed a lump in one of them and looked to discover its cause. Inside her sock she found a little sack holding gold enough for both food and dowry. Her family and her future were safe. The next daughter also received a sack of gold before her wedding day, and when the time came for the third girl to marry, her father determined to stay awake and see who kept showing them such kindness. When he heard the clink of the coins, he ran out to see who had left them. He was just fast enough to catch a young man whose face he knew from church. When the father attempted to thank him, he told him rather to thank God.
That kind young man had inherited a fortune when his parents had died in a plague. A mere teen at the time, he had gone to live with his uncle, who was a priest. Before long his uncle had enlisted him as a lector, which meant it was his job to read the Scriptures at worship. His life showed the influence of those Scriptures, for he is remembered by all accounts as one who gave generously (though quietly) to the poor.

Eventually he became a priest and then bishop. He served in the Council of Nicea among his many good deeds and he was canonized as a saint after he died. The sixth of December was set apart as “St. Nick’s Day” because the orphan who became a Bishop was none other than St. Nicholas. After he died people continued his tradition of giving anonymous gifts to the poor, and such gifts were often attributed to “St. Nicholas.”

The Dutch called him Sante Klaas, Klaas being short for Nicholas, and New Yorkers, took over the Dutch name with a slight change in spelling: Santa Claus. His rich red bishop’s habit and hat are famous everywhere. Saint Nick’s Day in the Netherlands it is still the main December holiday for exchanging gifts but as time went on but in places like America the St. Nick traditions somehow attached themselves to Christmas. American Children in still hang stockings by the chimney for St. Nick to stuff with goodies, but few of them know the story behind the custom.
When you separate facts from fiction then, you find that Santa was a Bishop, not an elf. He never lived at the North Pole, and never drove a reindeer. But, he was a historic person, born in 280 AD in Asia Minor. And, he loved to give gifts, in secret whenever possible, and at least once in a stocking near a chimney. So, when well-meaning parents tell their children there is no such thing as Santa Claus, their attempt at being totally honest is unfortunately half a lie. The mythical Santa is a farce, but Saint Nicholas is real. He lived in a town called Patara in what is now Turkey. He never went to tinsel town but he did made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He never heard of Frosty the Snowman, but he well knew the story of the babe in a manger and he would be very sad indeed to learn that he had become a distraction from the true meaning of Christmas.

But what is the true and essential meaning of Christmas? It has to do with Christ’s birth. St. John gives us, if not the first Noel, at least the shortest Noel, the briefest description of Christ’s nativity (birth). We wouldn’t expect him to mention Santa, eggnog and Rudolph, but John even leaves out St. Luke’s shepherds and Matthew’s Magi and both of their angels. His Christmas story is just one line:

The Word became flesh and pitched his tent in our midst.

Matthew and Luke tell us how Jesus came to earth— announced by angels, born of a virgin, swaddled in a manger, surrounded by shepherds, and etc. John focuses on who it was that came. As in the case of Santa, this can be a little confusing. To some Jesus is merely a teacher of morality, to others, merely a prophet. Still others have him as a kind of magic man, and then there are those who tell their children he is only make believe—like Santa. When you clear up the confusion surrounding Jesus, who are you really left with? John tells us, and his truth is stranger than fiction.
He gives Jesus some mysterious names in the passage we read tonight. He calls him the Word, and he calls him “The True Light,” and God’s only begotten Son. In the beginning, says John, “was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” That this Word is actually a person, is clear from the pronouns attached to it. “All things,” says John, “were made through him, and without him was nothing made which has been made.” Reading on we find that this person, this incarnate word, is Jesus Christ. And here’s John’s Christmas,

“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.” That’s it!

Jesus was born in Bethlehem, but his birth was not his beginning. There never was a time when he was not. He was with God in the beginning. He was with God, and he was God, but at a particular point in history he became flesh, that is, he became a human being. Like Matthew’s Immanuel, John’s Word is somehow God with us.

Why did he become flesh though? “I have come, said Jesus, “ that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness. 11I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.”

Saint Nicholas was moved to compassion when he saw people who were alive, but hardly having life in all its fullness. He used all he had to help all he could, those he knew of, those whose needs could be met with his resources. As a Bishop he was a good shepherd and Jesus was his example in all of this. John records seven of Christ’s mighty signs. They show that Jesus both cared about the needy, and had the power to help them. He was the first quiet patron of marriage, anonymously relieving shame and shortage at the wedding feast in Cana. He also healed the helpless lame man by the pool of Bethesda, and raised Lazarus from a death four days deep. Christ’s signs revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him. These signs are enough to lead us to believe his promise of abundant life. They are even evidence that the remarkable claims John makes in chapter one are true.
But of course Jesus performed an eighth sign. He laid down his life for his sheep, but what an upside-down sort of a sign this was. The cross was not a display of healing; it was a display of dying. It was not a taking on of human flesh, but a destruction of human flesh. Christ’s other signs displayed power, but not so here. It’s why his disciples tried to talk him out of the cross—it was the very opposite of the glory signs, but he said, “If I be lifted up from the earth—lifted up, he meant, upon a cross— I will draw all men unto me. Why was this the supreme sign of his glory?
Well, consider this. Everyone Jesus fed grew hungry again. Everyone he healed of one thing eventually died of something else. Even Lazarus, who he raised from death, would one day die again. But those Jesus died for would have everlasting life.
The Word, had become flesh, so that he could die in the flesh. This seeming failure, this seeming sign of weakness was nothing of the sort. Luther called the cross the devil’s mouse trap. He smelled cheese, and Wham! Felt steel. Appearing too weak to save even himself, Christ was actually saving the world. Apparently death’s victim, he was in reality death’s demise.

And, somehow, by Christ’s death, our alienation from our Creator was remedied. Somehow, his death purchased the forgiveness of our sins. Somehow, his death bought us a life abundant and free and satisfying. He came to die once, so that we might live forever.

This does not happen automatically for everyone, but John tells us how it happened to some. Perhaps it could happen to you:
“to as many as did receive him, he gave the right to become sons of God.”

To receive him means to believe in him, to trust in him for the forgiveness of sins, for reconciliation with God the Father, and for the beginning, the foretaste, of the abundant life man was made for in the beginning.

Friends, the true meaning of Christmas is this, that Jesus, who was with God in the beginning, became flesh and lived among us because we needed a new beginning, what John describes as a “new birth.” Nicholas gave the three maidens a new chance, and God offers us one we need just as desperately. Christmas reveals his glory and moves us to believe in him, to turn away from evil, to receive his gifts, and to hope in his promise of peace on earth, good will to men on whom his favor rests. A long time ago, in a land far, far away, God’s Son became flesh and dwelt among us. This night we have glimpsed his glory. + Amen.

Advent
The arrival of a notable person, thing, or event is called an “advent,” as in, the advent of the internet. Advent is also a technical term, referring either to the first or second “arrival” of Christ. The season of Advent consists of the four weeks leading up to Christmas, but looking also beyond it to the day Bethlehem’s baby will come again in great glory. The past confirms the future, for He who pledged us Christmas has pledged the 2nd Coming also.

And don’t we all realize that this world is not yet what it might be? Like the blind man whom our Lord healed in two stages, one stage is complete, but another awaits completion. Timothy Keller notes that “through all of life there runs a ground note of cosmic disappointment.” No matter how perfect our lives here become, it is never quite enough, because we were made for another life. The first carol of Christmas came from another world which ours has not yet fully engaged .

That first Christmas gave — and still gives — a foretaste of the future banquet that will satisfy to the fullest and disappoint not at all. For now, though, like a child marking off the days until term break, we light a candle each Sunday in Advent. Each candle brings us closer to Christmas, and to that second Advent whose trumpets will mute the ground note of disappointment eternally. Let all who long for this say: Even so, come Lord Jesus.
